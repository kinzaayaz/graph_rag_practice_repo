California pioneered the LCFS in 2007, and versions have since been developed in other parts of North America, with LCFS-like policies emerging in Europe and Brazil. There is still relatively little research on the contribution that an LCFS can make to a climate policy mix. In this review, we summarize evidence and research gaps using a four-category interdisciplinary framework: effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, political acceptability, and transformative signal. First, regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, several studies demonstrate that existing LCFS policies have helped to cut emission to date, while modeling studies indicate that a stronger LCFS can play an additive mitigation role in a well-designed policy mix over the long-term. Second, policy cost-effectiveness is more uncertain; some studies suggests that although an LCFS is not likely to be as efficient as a carbon price, a well-designed LCFS could be an efficient complement to a mix that includes carbon pricing. Third is political and social acceptability, where numerous studies show that the LCFS receives substantial citizen support—more so than any pricing mechanism. Fourth is transformative signal, where the LCFS is associated with increased investment in low-carbon fuels and supportive infrastructure, and a stronger version could induce even more innovation in the long-term. We conclude by identifying research gaps, including the need to better understand the impacts of biofuels on indirect land-use and other sustainability measures, as well as improved simulation of longer-term technological change under a more stringent LCFS, including policy mix interactions.\n\n<a id='1b8aa9d7-718e-4303-ac1e-067a97bb8971'></a>\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nThis paper reviews evidence and identifies research gaps relating to the low-carbon carbon fuel standard (LCFS). An LCFS requires fuel suppliers to progressively decrease the average GHG intensity of their fuels on a life-cycle basis. The policy is based on the well-to-wheels \"carbon intensity\" of transport fuels, measured in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule (gCO2e/MJ). Life-cycle in this case refers to all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from fuel feedstock production, refining, distribution, and consumption—which is often termed \"well-to-wheels\" impacts. By definition, an LCFS is focused on well-to-wheel emissions and is not simply a mandate to blend in some proportion of biofuels into a region's liquid fuel mix (Farrell and Sperling, 2007b). The LCFS is meant to increase the uptake of low-carbon forms biofuels, as well as low-carbon forms of electricity- and hydrogen-powered transportation.\n\n<a id='b7a73605-72b4-4c6e-a0a8-ff0757b2af87'></a>\n\nCalifornia pioneered the LCFS in 2007, which has since become part\nof an overall effort to achieve deep decarbonization goals, notably car-\nbon neutrality by 2045 (CARB, 2022a). In part, the LCFS was developed\nas a reaction to the US national biofuel blending mandate, which\nrequired usage of biofuels, but initially did not differentiate biofuels\nbased on the carbon intensity of their different feedstocks and produc-\ntion methods (Yeh et al., 2016). The original California LCFS required\nfuel suppliers to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold\nin the state by 10% by 2020, and it has since been extended to require a\nreduction of 20% by 2030.\n\n<a id='5c6ed9b9-3646-4768-9b5b-834cd4026814'></a>\n\nVersions of an LCFS have also been enacted in the Canadian province\nof British Columbia (in 2011) and the state of Oregon (2016)—both now\nhave the same 2030 targets as California (Mazzone et al., 2021). An\nLCFS will take effect in Washington state as well as across Canada in\n2023. Elements of a LCFS have been implemented in renewable fuel\nrequirements in the United Kingdom and the European Union, including\n\n<a id='5651069a-5200-4db8-8fb4-a9f17a060842'></a>\n\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: jaxsen@sfu.ca (J.

Brazil's RenovaBio program also requires lifecycle evaluations of biofuel relating to GHG emissions and other impacts (Grangeia et al., 2022).\n\n<a id='9eba6421-22d9-47ac-9752-115ccc7e7951'></a>\n\nThe North American versions of an LCFS can be considered as market-oriented regulations. They are regulations in the sense that there is a carbon intensity target (or limit) that fuel providers must comply with. The LCFS is also market-oriented in that fuel suppliers can trade and bank emission credits and can chose how they reduce the carbon intensity of the fuels they produce. The latter component is meant to improve the policy's technology-neutrality and cost-effectiveness (Farrell and Sperling, 2007a; Yeh et al., 2016), giving fuel suppliers a wide range of compliance options. As examples, fuel suppliers can comply through actions such as (California Air Resources Board, 2020a):\n\n<a id='9f1db989-f718-48a1-8289-ea21088abc9d'></a>\n\n• blending low-carbon renewable fuels with fossil fuels, including ethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, renewable jet fuel, and renewable naphtha;\n• supporting alternative fuel vehicles (and related infrastructure) using energy sources such as electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, and propane; or\n• reductions in carbon emissions along the petroleum supply chain by capturing and storing CO2, producing hydrogen from renewable resources (e.g. biomass), using innovating crude oil production methods (e.g. using renewable electricity for oil production), or making refinery process improvements (e.g. energy efficiency improvements, replacing gas turbines with electric motors).\n\n<a id='46e3c898-df44-4e20-8ee6-01513358b96f'></a>\n\nFuel suppliers can generate these credits themselves or they can buy excess credits from other fuel suppliers or third-party credit producers. Again, this credit-trading option is meant to improve the cost-effectiveness of the policy, encouraging more GHG mitigation to occur where it is lowest cost.\n\n<a id='c53b98a1-e4cb-417d-a212-d1b5f9f89d37'></a>\n\nThis paper summarizes evidence for the potential impacts of an LCFS\n\n<a id='75c612d9-c339-4597-b25a-b9c670074b8b'></a>\n\nas a climate policy. Next we summarize our interdisciplinary framework\nfor evaluation, and then proceed with a summary of current evidence\nand research gaps.\n\n<a id='225ce34d-b421-4d00-8c2c-7fba9c85480f'></a>\n\n2. An interdisciplinary framework for climate policy mixes\nThe design and evaluation of climate policy can be highly complex, especially when seeking to induce technological change and achieve deep decarbonization goals that are decades into a highly uncertain future. To organize insights and research gaps on the LCFS, we draw from Bhardwaj et al.'s (2020) interdisciplinary framework, which identifies four broad evaluation criteria based on a review of literature from several disciplines, including engineering, economics, policy studies, and innovations studies (Table 1).\n\n<a id='9978571d-e89b-43e1-bc2e-20a0c8a154db'></a>\n\nTo start, this framework considers the LCFS as part of a policy mix. There is a broad body of research supporting the effectiveness and even necessity of policy mixes for energy and climate policy worldwide (Axsen et al., 2020; Bhardwaj et al., 2020; Kivimaa and Kern, 2016; Rogge et al., 2017). California in particular is well known for pioneering an effective policy mix for climate goals in the transport sector, addressing all three \"legs of the stool\": reduced fuel carbon intensity (including the LCFS), increased vehicle fuel efficiency, and reduced travel demand (vehicle km travelled) (Brown et al., 2021; Sperling and Eggert, 2014). There is inevitably some overlap in coverage and impact among policies, but in some cases that may desirable - with the goal of sending a clear and strong signal to industry, stakeholders, and society that the low-carbon transition is underway. Analyses of California and Canada suggest that the most effective and politically acceptable climate policies for transportation will include some mix of strong regulation and pricing (Axsen et al., 2020; Purdon et al., 2021)—a combination that could lead to a more cost-effective solution than regulations alone (Bhardwaj et al., 2022b).\n\n<a id='a1e80622-a843-4999-8a90-d8d579fc7754'></a>\n\nOur four-category interdisciplinary framework considers the various\nsocietal motivations for adding another policy to the mix (Table 1).

In this paper, we focus on the ability of the LCFS to induce incremental reductions in GHG emissions from the transportation sector, from a well-to-wheels perspective. Several published studies explore the LCFS from this perspective, without considering the other criteria noted below. A particularly important question is how stringent the LCFS needs to be in order help a policy mix to achieve deep GHG emissions mitigation goals.\n\n<a id='06a11566-8db3-4831-8599-6f588b18eb73'></a>\n\nOther societal impacts of an LCFS have received less study. We note that globally there is an emerging distinction between conventional and \"advanced\" biofuels that accounts for both GHG and other sustainability criteria. Conventional biofuels—notably corn, sugarcane, and soybeans—use food-based crops, compete for land with food, and can have a wide range of lifecycle GHG emissions impacts (IEA, 2021e). In contrast, advanced biofuels are defined as fuels that (IEA, 2021e, p205):\ni) deliver significant lifecycle GHG reductions compared to the fossil fuels they are replacing, ii) are produced from non-food crop feedstocks, iii) do not directly compete for land with food or feed crops, and iv) do not cause other adverse sustainability or biodiversity impacts. Advanced feedstocks made up 7% of global biofuel production in 2020, and the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario assumes an increase to 45% by 2030 (IEA, 2021). However, as we will identify in this review, there is currently relatively less research on how an LCFS can induce advanced biofuel uptakes, as well as LCFS impacts to co-benefits, such as air pollution, land-use, and other sustainability impacts.\n\n<a id='0069a4bc-96c3-4cc4-990d-55f9c5696433'></a>\n\nThe second evaluation criterion is cost-effectiveness or efficiency,\nwhich is typically calculated as the social welfare costs of the GHG\nmitigation, represented as the $/tonne CO2e abated. These costs typi-\ncally include impacts to consumer surplus and producer surplus. Of\ncourse, there is some overlap with the first criterion, as an ineffective\npolicy is not going to be efficient. But there is also an important nuance\nin how policy costs relate to the degree of policy stringency—where\nmarginal cost per tonne CO₂e abated can only be used to compare effi-\nciency between similarly stringent policies. Clearly an LCFS leading to\ngreater emissions reductions would also have a higher marginal cost\nthan a much less stringent policy, but that does not demonstrate that the\nLCFS is less efficient. Finally, cost-effectiveness analyses are inherently\nchallenging in the context of complexity—with multiple policies that\ninteract, potentially over decades to induce substantial innovation and\ntransformative change.\n\n<a id='77f56df9-3e34-4aba-b7ae-b8424a8e60ae'></a>\n\nThird is political acceptability, which is largely drawn from policy studies and considers the real-world aspects of politics that are often neglected in studies that focus purely on GHG mitigation or economic efficiency (Rosenbloom et al., 2020). Notably, citizen and stakeholder support or opposition regarding a policy or policy mix can play a critical role in the implementation (or not) of the policy (Justen et al., 2014; Rogge et al., 2017). Our definition considers acceptability by citizens (or the public), which can be assessed by surveys of representative samples (Eriksson et al., 2008; Rhodes et al., 2017). An international meta-analysis finds that citizen support for climate pricing and related policies is most strongly related to their perceptions of equity impacts (or fairness) and effectiveness in reducing emissions (Bergquist et al., 2022). Social support is also strongly influence by trust in the governing institutions (Bergquist et al., 2022), especially their trust in policymaker \"competence\" (Kitt et al., 2021). Political acceptability also includes the perceptions (and political clout) of special interest groups, such as oil companies, electric utilities, and biofuel companies.\n\n<a id='971318ae-1ac5-4b0c-bab9-f61e3516eb98'></a>\n\nOur final criterion is transformative signal which draws from the disciplines of innovations studies and sociotechnical systems (Geels, 2002; Weber and Rohracher, 2012). This criterion is likely to be especially important in the context of strong, long-term societal goals, such as achieving net-zero GHG emissions within 25–30 years. Technological change is a complex and dynamic process, involving interactions across many actors in the system (Foxon and Pearson, 2008; Rosenbloom et al., 2020; Weber and Rohracher, 2012). Therefore, moving away from the status quo of conventional fossil fuels involves a wide array of social, technological, institutional, and infrastructural challenges.\n\n<a id='66788704-4e0e-4442-820e-527633f897a0'></a>\n\nConsequently, the addition of a policy to a policy mix can be worthwhile\nif it improves the credibility of the transition, and thus stimulates the\nneeded transformation (Nemet et al., 2017). This transformative signal\ncan be improved by the inclusion of more stringent policies, and those\nwith longer-time horizons—even if there is some overlap in those pol-\nicies in terms of GHG mitigation effectiveness. The strength of signal can\nalso relate to technological specificity, where for example a carbon price\nmight be too technology-neutral to overcome the barrier of R&D spill-\nover effects that supress innovation (Azar and Sandén, 2011; Lehmann,\n\n<a id='ecafc1f7-23da-4686-80a1-36ed48eb54b6'></a>\n\n2012). Therefore, technology-pushing regulations might prove complementarity to pricing by inducing more technological change in the long-run (Jaffe et al., 2005).\n\n<a id='23fe6645-6ac3-481d-96ba-d36324ad76df'></a>\n\nHowever, it can be difficult to isolate and measure transformation\nand transformative signal, and to establish causality between the policy\nand the transformation activities. Potential measures include innovation\nactivity, such as increased investment in low-carbon biofuels, the\nemergence of new types of biofuel feedstock and production methods,\nand increases support for low-carbon fuels, vehicles, and supporting\ninfrastructure (Axsen et al., 2022b; Bhardwaj et al., 2020). An added\nchallenge is that LCFS policies in existence have mostly focused on\nmarginal GHG reduction goals (10–20% reductions in fuel carbon in-\ntensity), where a more stringent, long-term LCFS could lead to sub-\nstantially different R&D investment and innovation strategies.\nTransformative signal can also include improvements in institutional\ncapacity, including the development of the organizations and processes\nneeded to increase the uptake of low-carbon fuels.\n\n<a id='7f8fc9f0-9137-472d-8bfe-dfc6718ffe8d'></a>\n\nWe believe that explicit recognition of these four criteria, and the potential trade-offs among them, can improve evaluation and dialogue relating to climate policies within the context of a real-world policy mix. Of course, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of a given policy in contributing to GHG emissions reductions. Though that analysis alone is incomplete. Further, most regulations or pricing can be highly effective, if the stringency is high enough. The limiter for stringency might not be set by technical constraints, but by constraints set according to political acceptability or cost-effectiveness. So, a stringent policy might be effective, but might have low cost-effectiveness, or low political acceptability. In contrast, a policy that does not do much to induce GHG reductions might have other values in a policy mix, such as improving cost-effectiveness, political acceptability (via improved equity or other means), or transformative signal (including credibility). By considering all four categories of impact, we hope to avoid a simple diagnosis or dismissal of a particular policy—as the different impacts will vary by regional context, policy design, stringency, and interactions with the rest of a policy mix.\n\n<a id='c2d91357-0f23-4a65-8453-132a5b969b58'></a>\n\nTable 1 summarizes these four policy mix evaluation criteria, along\nwith potential quantitative measures. We have attempted to include all\navailable peer-reviewed literature on this policy via searches of various\ndatabases, as well as relevant grey-literature. Our interpretations\nconsider both the quality and quantity of published studies. The two\ncolumns on the right summarizes the evidence and research gaps that we\nidentify in this paper.\n\n<a id='3b86435c-0908-4b8b-b18a-e2640bc17935'></a>\n\n## 3. Evidence for the LCFS\n\n### 3.1. *Effectiveness at GHG mitigation*\n\nWe consider two broad categories of evidence regarding the effectiveness of an LCFS in terms of reducing GHG emissions. Some studies focus on data from the past, say, for a region that implemented the policy. Analysts then use statistical analysis to identify the additive impact of the policy. This approach is based in real-world data and can provide useful insight, though doesn't provide a complete picture of potential future impacts and system dynamics. A second broad category of research uses forward-looking models (ideally with some empirical basis for their parameters) to anticipate the long-term impacts of a climate policy. In particular, a strong climate policy might induce\n\n<a id='edc4974a-304a-4e50-bb72-52f406267eff'></a>\n\n56\n\n<a id='94b6aaf6-fc8b-461b-a62f-51ad9b1e4754'></a>\n\nJ. Axsen and M.

One study used three different statistical analysis (econometric techniques) to find “robust evidence” that the LCFS reduced California’s transport GHG emissions by around 10% (controlling for other climate policies in place), compared to a counterfactual scenario with no LCFS (Huseynov and Palma, 2018). Another detailed study on the production of ethanol in the US indicates that an LCFS incentivizes the uptake of less carbon intensive farming practices – changes that would not occur without the policy in place (Liu et al., 2020). Recent assessments of the LCFS in California, Oregon, and British Columbia indicates that all three policies have achieved their carbon intensity requirements (Mazzone et al., 2021).\n\n<a id='a5177b05-bbe0-462b-9e13-730aff15d813'></a>\n\nSeveral studies use forward-looking simulation models to estimate the potential impacts of an LCFS out to 2030 and 2050. For example, some early modeling in California indicated that the LCFS would be responsible for about 20% of the GHG reductions in the transport sector by 2050 (Bedsworth et al., 2011). Another study used a dynamic model that integrates the US transport and agricultural sectors, finding that an LCFS could induce GHG reductions out to 2035 (the end of the model's time horizon), even when accounting for market feedbacks such as changes in fuel and food prices (Huang et al., 2013). Simulation modeling based in Canada found that an LCFS requiring a 15–20% reduction in carbon intensity of fuels could help the country to meet 2030 Paris Agreement targets, while an 80% reduction in carbon intensity could achieve 2050 GHG targets consistent with the Paris Agreement (Vass and Jaccard, 2017). A California-based modeling study simulated the impacts of a LCFS programs requiring 10%–25% reductions in fuel carbon intensity by 2030, finding that the policy can contribute to substantial additional GHG reductions, even with a policy mix that includes cap-and-trade (ICF, 2017).\n\n<a id='4dbfb494-6afc-4c93-a53d-605044d8b853'></a>\n\nHere we provide a more detailed explanation of one particular published modeling study (Lepitzki and Axsen, 2018). The study is unique in that it explores the role of an LCFS in the context of deep GHG emissions reductions in the long-term (2050), while considering a full suite of policy mixes, and including endogenous modeling of technological changes as well as dynamics in consumer preferences (summarized elsewhere, e.g., Axsen et al., 2009; Horne et al., 2005; Jaccard, 2009). The authors simulated several policy scenarios, with different levels of an LCFS as follows.\n\n<a id='2bb564ac-393d-4c3d-8eb9-49b8fc4b6607'></a>\n\n• \"Ref\": the original LCFS requiring 10% reduction in lifecycle carbon intensity\n• \"Low\": requiring 25% reduction in carbon intensity\n• \"Medium\": requiring 40% reduction in carbon intensity\n• \"High\": requiring 75% reduction in carbon intensity\n\n<a id='6915e6ec-871d-4ac5-894e-31cbcef12d75'></a>\n\nThe scenarios include several stringencies of other policy mixes.\n\n* \"Weak\" policy package: $30/tonne carbon tax, fuel efficiency standards (CAFE) reducing vehicle consumption by 34%, and zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate requiring that 14% of vehicle sales be ZEVs.\n* \"Moderate\" policy package: carbon tax increasing to $118/tonne, CAFE/fuel efficiency standards reducing vehicle consumption by 57%, and ZEV mandate requiring that 65% of vehicle sales be ZEVs.\n* \"Ambitious\" policy package: carbon tax increasing to $350/tonne, CAFE/fuel efficiency standards reducing vehicle consumption by 65%, and ZEV mandate requiring that 100% of vehicle sales be ZEVs.\n\n<a id='5729e53a-cd38-4ac2-b6ef-17953429c891'></a>\n\nAs summarized in Fig. 1, this study finds that when combined with other stringent policies (including carbon pricing), a strong LCFS could be responsible for about 12–20% of the GHG reductions from 2007 levels by 2050 (Lepitzki and Axsen, 2018). In all simulated scenarios, an LCFS results in greater GHG reductions when added to the policy mix. That same study found that the additive effects of the LCFS could be particularly strong in the freight sector (not shown), which has fewer and less stringent climate regulations in the baseline (and thus less overlap with other policies) than the passenger vehicle sector.\n\n<a id='594e5166-0094-49a5-96a3-797414ab3594'></a>\n\nAlthough these modeling studies indicate the potential promise of an LCFS, there are important limitations and omissions in the literature. Most of these studies do not consider the nuances of LCFS design, such as credit-trading, or whether the policy addresses electricity or only liquid fuels. More modeling is needed to understand the nature and degree of overlap across regulations, especially between a ZEV sales mandate and LCFS. Further, there is substantial uncertainty as to how an LCFS might induce technological change in low-carbon fuels (noted in the trans-formative change section below), as well as regarding low-carbon ve-hicles. Any simulation modeling of long-term LCFS impacts need to have detailed, endogenous representation of technological change (Azar and Dowlatabadi, 1999). We further address the criterion of transformative signal in Section 3.4. Finally, more research is needed to better under-stand the particular challenges that face the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sectors, including long-haul freight and various vocational uses. There is also uncertainty regarding how an LCFS treats indirect land-\n\n<a id='5cd44c54-f163-471c-8513-96c82098f299'></a>\n\n<::transcription of the content\n: line chart::>\nThis multi-panel line chart displays \"Total Transport\" WTW GHG Emissions (kt CO2e) on the left y-axis and \"% GHG Reduction from 2007\" on the right y-axis, over the years 2005 to 2050 on the x-axis.

The ICCT suggests that ILUC emissions can be mitigated by including a cap on the amount of food-based biofuels that can be used to comply with the LCFS (ICCT, 2022).\n\n<a id='de1b3578-3932-4dfb-b681-562a9f4bccdb'></a>\n\n3.2. Cost-effectiveness\n\nIn addition to being effective, some policymakers and stakeholders want a policy to be efficient. Indeed, economists are often strongly or even solely focused on this criterion for policy evaluation. Cost-effectiveness for climate policy is typically considered according to the goal of minimizing GHG mitigation costs ($/per tonne CO2e), which typically is framed in terms of impacts to consumer surplus and industry profits. A broader perspective could consider other social welfare \"co-benefits\", such as impacts regarding traffic congestion, accidents, or air pollution (e.g., Small, 2012), as well as potential negative impacts, say from increased agricultural activity on erosion, habitat loss, crop prices, water pollution, and overall ecosystem services (Holland et al., 2015). Analyses might also consider impacts to overall economic activity (GDP) or jobs in a given sector, say through a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that accounts for intersectoral linkages. Simulating the policy interactions that determine cost-effectiveness can be even more challenging than simulating GHG impacts, as such analyses must account for uncertainties in the long-term dynamics of consumer and industry behaviour, as well as economic activity (Greene et al., 2016)— and in the case of biofuels, the complexities of agricultural activity.\n\n<a id='a400c6f0-02a4-4d93-a068-17b4d6ab742a'></a>\n\nA pricing mechanism is typically expected to be more efficient than an LCFS, mainly because pricing is technology-neutral and incentivizes the full range of compliance options (reduced carbon intensity of fuels, improved vehicle efficiency, and reduced travel/activity) - whereas an LCFS only focuses on fuel carbon intensity (gCO2e/MJ). In some cases, earlier economic studies focused on such inefficiencies. For example, Holland et al. (2009) found that a national US LCFS would have very high mitigation costs ($300 to $2300 per tonne). However, the analysis focused on a fairly weak, short-term LCFS (10% reductions in carbon intensity) without detailed representation of potential technological change. A later study found an LCFS to be much more costly than cap-and-trade system (Holland et al., 2015), though again the analysis focused on a 10% LCFS only, and representations of technological change focused on conventional and cellulosic ethanol, without explicit representation of low-carbon electricity, hydrogen, or alternatives to diesel.\n\n<a id='942be145-33ab-4ecf-89b1-a397f9afa5ac'></a>\n\nClearly, the efficiency of an LCFS will relate to its stringency. Some studies suggest that an LCFS can have similar efficiency as a carbon price, if both policies are designed to achieve the same relatively large reduction in emissions. A modelling analysis of a carbon tax and the LCFS in California demonstrated that each policy caused the same change in societal welfare when designed to reduce annual emissions by more than 20 MtCO2e/yr (roughly 5% of California's current emissions) (Scheitrum, 2020). When both policies are equally stringent, this study suggests that they ultimately incentivize the same abatement actions. Similarly, another modelling study comparing a carbon price and LCFS (that achieve the same GHG goal) found that both policies produced very similar changes in vehicle technologies and fuel consumption (Vass and Jaccard, 2017), and thus, presumably similar changes in welfare impacts. For example, by 2050, 75–80% of light-duty vehicles use\n\n<a id='24e4dd9c-a6e8-4d28-a239-c6ddec79ba85'></a>\n\nlow-carbon alternative fuels (electricity or E85), regardless of pricing or LCFS approach.\n\n<a id='90926813-2c39-4f53-873c-4eff8e0f727e'></a>\n\nPolicy costs will also be impacted by LCFS design. In particular, the compliance flexibility and cost containment mechanisms of LCFS policies can help to control compliance costs, and also help to mimic the compliance actions of a carbon price. For example, a credit cost ceiling (so called \"safety valve\" credits which can be purchased from the government at a fixed price) is argued to be important to align the cost-effectiveness of an LCFS with a comparably strong carbon price (Scheitrum, 2020).\n\n<a id='d06c5a54-ad73-4125-878b-023b639044ed'></a>\n\nCompliance costs can be further reduced through design features such as credit banking and credit trading. For example, a multi-model study of a hypothetical US-wide LCFS indicated that these mechanisms can reduce the average cost of compliance by about 7% (Rubin and Leiby, 2013), though the impact can be much greater depending on differences in compliance costs in the gasoline and diesel pool and the availability of safety valve credits. In an extreme case, when compliance for one fuel pool is much more expensive than for the other and there are limited safety valve credits, trading and banking can reduce average compliance costs by more than 85% (Rubin and Leiby, 2013). Credit trading between regions can similarly reduce compliance costs if an LCFS is applied across multiple regions with different abatement costs (Rubin et al., 2014).\n\n<a id='58d8bf94-e59f-40a7-bee3-2b0292006262'></a>\n\nFurther, the design of policy mix will also impact policy costs. While it can be challenging to directly compare an LCFS versus pricing mechanism, it seems more likely that the efficiency of an LCFS can potentially be improved if one or more pricing mechanism is included in the policy mix. Dimanchev and Knittel (2020) suggests that the combination of a modest carbon price with market-oriented regulation is more efficient than the regulation alone. Specifically, setting up the policy mix such that the carbon price (e.g. cap and trade) achieves roughly 20–25% of the overall GHG abatement reduces the cost of achieving GHG targets by 40–70%, relative to using the regulation alone. The modest carbon price incentivizes the use of low-cost GHG reduction actions that are outside the scope of the regulation. Meanwhile, the more stringent regulation achieves the desired quantity of GHG abatement. Although their paper focused on a general renewable energy standard, the lead author confirmed that the result is also true for the case of an LCFS (personal communication). Modeling in California similarly suggests that the addition of an LCFS to a complex policy mix (including cap-and-trade) leads to some complementarity in terms of GHG compliance costs (ICF, 2017). Similar results regarding the complementarity of pricing mechanisms and regulations have been found for fuel economy standards (Small, 2012).\n\n<a id='d047f1a6-1ceb-4c44-bc2a-a8fda1982978'></a>\n\nWhile these studies provide some insight, there is still considerable\nuncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of an LCFS, both in com-\nparison to other policy options (pricing and other regulations), and\nwhen implemented as part of a policy mix. More modeling research is\nneeded to anticipate the uncertain long-term costs of an LCFS, including\ndifferent stringency levels, and in different combinations with other\npolicies. Such modeling needs to tackle the challenges and uncertainties\nof modeling endogenous technological change (e.g., learning curves)\nand dynamics in consumer behaviour for both passenger and commer-\ncial users.\n\n<a id='8068eed6-7a63-4e05-b16f-7d84c7ceafdc'></a>\n\n### 3.3. Political acceptability\n\nPolitical acceptability is a particularly important, and often under-appreciated, component of real-world policy analysis. Even if a climate policy is shown to be effective and efficient, it is not likely to be implemented if policymakers perceive it will be rejected by citizens and key stakeholders. Here we focus on research on citizen acceptance of the LCFS in North American regions. Numerous studies have shown that market-oriented regulations such as the LCFS are more widely supported by the public than carbon pricing policies (Rhodes et al., 2014, 2015). A 2013 Canadian survey found that support was much higher for the LCFS\n\n<a id='8eab849d-942b-4bd2-b621-991832a20b75'></a>\n\n\n\n<a id='c8c3cddb-3172-4f9d-9e25-63d49f298089'></a>\n\nJ. Axsen and M. Wolinetz\n\n<a id='1ab046c7-e5ac-4fe7-9663-c0bb979a4993'></a>\n\nTransport Policy 133 (2023) 54–63\n\n<a id='b943a457-3206-4179-8f11-9c1b7c551db3'></a>\n\n(88% support, 12% oppose) than for a cap-and-trade system (70% support, 30% oppose) or a carbon tax (53% support, 47% oppose) (Rhodes et al., 2017). Further statistical analysis indicates that while carbon pricing is more opposed by those that rely on personal vehicles for commuting, support for the LCFS is independent of vehicle ownership or usage.\n\n<a id='39dc2f91-d8da-40fc-8f88-69dc2a55a82c'></a>\n\nSimilar results were found in a 2019 survey conducted with repre-sentative samples of citizens in California and Canada, where the ma-jority of respondents support an LCFS (Long et al., 2020). Support is high for this policy when it requires a 20% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030, and support remains high even for a much stronger version requiring an 80% reduction by 2050 (Long et al., 2020). Comparing policy instruments (Fig. 2), support for a strong vehicle emissions standard (CAFE) and LCFS is similarly high across regions (around 60%-80% support), with lower support for a strong ZEV mandate (34%-55% support), and significantly lower support for strong carbon pricing (22%-30%). Rates of opposition are particularly high for carbon pricing, ranging from 45% to 65% of respondents.\n\n<a id='38f16b4e-9702-4b83-9973-4c44c47a57ed'></a>\n\nIn short, among the policies assessed, in North America the LCFS is found to be one of the most highly supported climate policies by citizens. The implication is that adding an LCFS to a policy mix is likely to be less politically risky than implementing a comparably effective or stringent carbon price. Though, there is more to learn about citizen perceptions of an LCFS, including how support or opposition relates to perceptions of equity impacts, effectiveness, and trust in policymakers and other stakeholders (Bergquist et al., 2022).\n\n<a id='0786440b-3793-4a6d-b135-33767b343c01'></a>\n\nThat said, such measures of citizen support only account for one potential component of political acceptability. Studies of stakeholder support, opposition and impacts on an LCFS are missing from the literature. Oil companies, biofuel companies, and electric utilities in particular have interests in an LCFS. We are not aware of any research on their potential influence in policy design. Drawing from other regulations, it has been found that automaker resistance has played a large role in changes to the design of California's ZEV mandate (Dyerson and Pilkington, 2005; Raux, 2004; Wesseling et al., 2014). It is likely that oil and biofuel companies can have similar impacts in regions that consider an LCFS. Further research could explore the recent behaviour of such stakeholders in regions that implement or reject an LCFS.\n\n<a id='52b27f14-0361-4c57-a71b-aee41d4654b3'></a>\n\n3.4. Transformative signal\n\n<a id='733abab8-9886-4d84-b104-fe70461a2577'></a>\n\nAs noted, transformative signal is an important criterion for a policy mix that seeks to induce long term-technology change and deep GHG emissions mitigation. However, this criterion is difficult to anticipate and analyze. The goal is for a policy mix to send a strong and durable signal, which occurs if the policies in the mix have a clear schedule of requirements over time (ideally over decades), with credible and stringent penalties for non-compliance (Nemet et al., 2017; Yeh et al., 2016). Because of the market predictability and \"push\" of the policy, a strong and credible LCFS can potentially improve the effectiveness of other policies (such as the cap and trade, carbon tax, vehicle emissions standard, or ZEV mandate) by giving more confidence for investments in low-carbon fuel supply, which leads to more supply (and potentially lower-cost supply) in the long-run.\n\n<a id='335beca0-deee-4835-8992-a7e0a6f8f29e'></a>\n\nPotential indicators include evidence for additional R&D investment, provision of supportive physical infrastructure, breaking the \"lock-in\" of incumbent industry and technology, and providing \"directionality\" as to which direction the low-carbon transition may take (Bhardwaj et al., 2020). However, the question of additive impact is still difficult to answer. It is hard to prove causality and net impact: does an LCFS lead to additive investment, development and deployment of low-carbon fuels that would not otherwise have been produced? And when an LCFS is in place only in some regions, does it lead to \"shuffling\" of relatively low-carbon fuels to the regulated region, and higher-carbon fuels to regions with less regulation (Bento et al., 2015)? As with Section 3.1 on effectiveness, evidence can be drawn from past observation and from forward-looking models—though important research gaps remain. Overall, we find some evidence that the presence of the LCFS in a region is linked to the reduced carbon intensities of biofuels sold in the region, deployment of a wider variety of lower-carbon fuels, and electric utility support for electric vehicles.\n\n<a id='7ae21624-3e22-4e19-9bec-c507693a4fd1'></a>\n\nFirst, we consider some observations from existing policies, though this evidence is mostly limited to association rather than causality. Since implementing the LCFS, California has recorded substantial declines in the carbon intensities of first-generation biofuels. From 2011 through 2021, the carbon intensity of ethanol used in California declined by 29% and the carbon intensity of biodiesel fell by 36% (Fig. 3) (CARB, 2022b).\n\n<a id='3c3d7047-e813-4d30-85e2-d6a8083320a2'></a>\n\n<::Bar chart showing the percentage of respondents for different policy measures across various regions.\n\nLegend:\n- Strongly oppose (dark red)\n- Somewhat oppose (light red)\n- Somewhat support (light blue)\n- Strongly support (dark blue)\n\nX-axis: Percentage of respondents, ranging from -80% to 100%.\n\nY-axis categories and data:\n\n1.

It is difficult to determine how much of these reductions are due to new innovation activity versus fuel supplier \"shuffling\" of lower-carbon fuel sources to the LCFS regulated regions.\n\n<a id='69720e9f-4c26-4a99-92e6-b16ea02b4e57'></a>\n\nFurther, data from California, Oregon, and British Columbia show the LCFS is associated with increasing quantity and variety of low-carbon transportation fuels being developed and used in each region. More transformation has been observed in the diesel pool, where biofuels blended with diesel in California (or as a substitute for diesel) accounted for 0.3% of diesel energy consumption at the start of 2011 rising to 40% by the end of 2021. There have been particularly large increases in renewable diesel and renewable natural gas, which were not available in those regions before an LCFS was implemented. Annual consumption of these fuels has been growing at 87% per year and 60% per year, respectively (Fig. 4). These two new biofuels supplied 59% of compliance credits in California 2021) (CARB, 2022b). In LCFS regions, landfill gas has made up an increasing proportion of natural gas feedstocks, while renewable diesel is mostly produced from corn oil, fish oil, tallow, or used cooking oil (Mazzone et al., 2021). Modelling supports the finding that an LCFS has been \"vital to the development of biomethane\" (p.292), making it cost competitive with fossil natural gas (Von Wald et al., 2019).\n\n<a id='c9616943-6233-409f-91c2-bf63c1566558'></a>\n\nIt seems likely that consumption of renewable diesel will continue to\n\n<a id='2b41fb6e-e22c-4334-9b16-f1a375248843'></a>\n\ngrow. Notably, there have been major investments in renewable diesel production capacity in California and announcements of even more to come (Biomass Magazine, 2020; Bloomberg, 2020; Globenewswire, 2018; Marathon, 2020; Oil, 2020), with similar investments observed in British Columbia (Energy, 2019; Parkland, 2020).\n\n<a id='a693df1c-45b8-41dc-9b62-4406bfe5cd85'></a>\n\nAlthough there has been less innovation observed in the gasoline pool, where ethanol production continues to be dominated by corn and wheat feedstocks (Mazzone et al., 2021), there is nonetheless evidence that LCFS policies are driving innovation. First, the LCFS appears to be supporting investment in ethanol production with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Starting in 2020, ethanol with CCS was recognized as a fuel pathway within the California LCFS (California Air Resources Board, 2020b), coinciding with additional funding being directed towards this technology (e.g., North Dakota Industrial Commission, 2020). Analysis suggests that LCFS credits could induce much more uptake of ethanol with CCS production throughout the US (Sanchez et al., 2018). Second, the value of LCFS carbon credits is forecasted to encourage more production of lower-carbon biofuels made from cellulosic feedstocks (Hu and Chen, 2019), which could lead to additive GHG reductions (Huang et al., 2013). Third, a spatial analysis of corn and soy production indicates that the observed reductions in ethanol carbon intensity may be the result of farming practices responding to a market signal for lower-carbon biofuels (Liu et al., 2020). Specifically, conservation tilling, use of cover crops, and more efficient use of fertilizer can substantially reduce the carbon intensity of both ethanol and biodiesel relative to a typical corn/soy crop rotation (by 30–50 gCO2e/MJ) (Liu et al., 2020).\n\n<a id='7e36c335-c58f-4895-871d-8ecb19417926'></a>\n\n<::stacked bar chart\nY-axis: Diesel gallon equivalents per year (10^6)\nX-axis: Years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021\nLegend:\n- Renewable natural gas (bio-CNG and LNG) (represented by the bottom, darker portion of the bars)\n- Renewable diesel (represented by the top, lighter portion of the bars)\n\nData points (approximate values for total diesel gallon equivalents per year):\n- 2011: 0\n- 2012: 0\n- 2013: ~130 (Renewable natural gas: ~20, Renewable diesel: ~110)\n- 2014: ~140 (Renewable natural gas: ~30, Renewable diesel: ~110)\n- 2015: ~230 (Renewable natural gas: ~50, Renewable diesel: ~180)\n- 2016: ~350 (Renewable natural gas: ~80, Renewable diesel: ~270)\n- 2017: ~430 (Renewable natural gas: ~100, Renewable diesel: ~330)\n- 2018: ~500 (Renewable natural gas: ~120, Renewable diesel: ~380)\n- 2019: ~750 (Renewable natural gas: ~140, Renewable diesel: ~610)\n- 2020: ~740 (Renewable natural gas: ~150, Renewable diesel: ~590)\n- 2021: ~1100 (Renewable natural gas: ~180, Renewable diesel: ~920)\n\nAdditional text on chart:\n- +60%/yr growth in renewable natural gas\n- +87%/yr growth in renewable diesel\nAn upward arrow indicates the overall growth trend.\nFig. 4.

This mechanism produces an incentive for electric utilities to further support PEV deployment. In California, electric utilities are required to use their credit revenue to support current or future PEV customers. Several utilities have opted to provide PEV purchase rebates, valued between $500 and $1500 per PEV (CARB, 2020). Though, it is quite difficult to isolate the impacts of such LCFS-inspired actions from the many other PEV-supportive policies in place in a given region, including other purchase incentives, carbon pricing, and vehicle regulations.\n\n<a id='61e2ae91-0621-46c4-a139-ce1217087a31'></a>\n\nOf course, the transformative signal of an LCFS will depend on the stringency of the policy. As noted earlier, the ICCT finds that a nation-wide US LCFS requiring 20–30% reductions in carbon intensity will mostly favour further development of conventional, food-based biofuels, which would only increase ILUC emissions accordingly (ICCT, 2022). An implication of this finding is that a technology-neutral LCFS of this stringency would not be strong enough to induce substantial innovation in alternative and waste based biofuels (ICCT, 2022). As we argued earlier, more forward-looking modeling effort is needed to simulate the potential long-term, transformative impacts of a more stringent LCFS, especially when implemented with a suite of complementary climate policies.\n\n<a id='1d33d1c6-81dd-4135-95d0-2075f7dd12cc'></a>\n\nAnother uncertainty is the potential for \"shuffling\" high-carbon fuels to regions without an LCFS. One promising sign is that most of North America is now subject to fuel blending mandates that account for carbon intensity in some way, meaning there are fewer places to \"dump\" high-carbon intensity biofuels. This includes the US Renewable Fuel Standard (US EPA, 2020), and sub-national blending mandates in Can-ada, for example in Alberta and Ontario (Government of Ontario, 2020; Province of Alberta, 2010). However, researchers and forward-looking models need to more carefully explore the interactions of LCFS policy across different countries and regions globally, which could include both shuffling of dirty fuels, as well as some innovation spillovers in bringing down the costs of new low-carbon fuel feedstocks.\n\n<a id='254f67d0-39d2-4a30-83a0-31bb7e411e64'></a>\n\nIn summary, there is some evidence that regions with an LCFS (and regions that sell into an LCFS region) have an improved transformative signal such that there has been increased investment in low-carbon fuels. Modeling efforts suggest that an LCFS can induce more innovation in low-carbon fuels, if suitably stringent, and depending on how other complex impacts are treated in the policy design, notably ILUC. However, it is difficult to causally link an LCFS to observed technological change, or to calculate net GHG impacts across regions. An even more challenging task is to simulate the future, long-term impacts of a significantly more stringent LCFS on technological change.\n\n<a id='0943729b-cf16-4463-a638-ee841451e251'></a>\n\n## 4. Research gaps\n\nOur summaries above (and Table 1) have identified numerous research gaps, where in general the LCFS is surprisingly understudied in the literature. Given the importance of the deep GHG reduction and decarbonization targets flowing from the Paris Agreement, and the enormous challenge of achieving net zero emissions (IEA, 2021), we place particular emphasis on the need for more forward-looking quantitative simulation modeling exercises. These models are needed to help understand and anticipate the many long-term dynamics that can be induced by a strong LCFS, including endogenous technology change (e. g., learning-by-doing and the emerging of new low-carbon technologies), changes in consumer preferences, and other market dynamics for various transportation fuels that are expected to play a strong role in deep decarbonization scenarios, notably low-carbon electricity, green hydrogen and advanced biofuels (IEA, 2021).\n\n<a id='06ab69a1-505f-4a3d-ac17-65f6c4c0ab77'></a>\n\nThese quantitative simulations need to include time horizons out to\n2030 to 2050, while simulating much more stringent versions of the\nLCFS (and other policies) than have yet been implemented in the real-\nworld. A major challenge is that these models need to endogenously\n\n<a id='6219175d-9027-4bdb-83a0-88aa5494fc52'></a>\n\nsimulate the broader system, including behavior on the demand and\nsupply side. An LCFS can impact consumer decision about vehicle pur-\nchase and usage, including light-duty passenger vehicle, as well as the\noperators of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. It can be particularly\nchallenging to assess how the various fuel suppliers, including oil\ncompanies, biofuel companies, and electric utilities may behave in the\nlong-term in response to strong LCFS policy. Perhaps even more difficult\nis to anticipate how stakeholders in other sectors may react, such as\nvehicle manufacturers.\n\n<a id='20261cd6-756f-4992-865d-6b65499205c5'></a>\n\nFurther, such models need to more systematically simulate policy interactions, including the effectiveness, efficiency, and transformation impacts of an LCFS - when implemented in combination with forms of carbon pricing and other technology regulations (vehicle emissions standard and ZEV mandate), subsidies, and deployment of charging and fueling infrastructure. More quantitative policy interaction studies are slowly emerging, but they still typically omit explicit modeling of an LCFS (e.g., Axsen et al., 2022a; Bhardwaj et al., 2022b; Lam and Mercure, 2021). Particular attention might be paid to certain types of policy overlap, such as the additive impact of an LCFS in the presence of a strong ZEV sales mandate, for example to address the question: is an LCFS needed if a strong ZEV mandate is already in place? Relatedly, questions of fuel \"shuffling\" across subnational regions or across the globe need to be addressed with spatially explicit models.\n\n<a id='4ac14c93-c775-42d4-985c-9b43f2bd2d99'></a>\n\nFurther, there are many remaining questions about how to best design an LCFS, such as calculations of WTW emissions, treatment of electricity versus liquid fuels, credit banking and trading, and penalties for non-compliance. The GHG emission and other sustainability impacts of ILUC are of particular concern, and require more research and dis-cussion to inform LCFS design (Lark et al., 2022). For example, it is unclear if ILUC values should lead to higher carbon intensity factors for certain fuels, or if a \"cap\" should be set for the usage of conventional, crop-based fuels (ICCT, 2022). Such nuance tends to be overlooked in modeling literature on climate regulations, but the design features of climate regulations have been shown to make an importance difference in GHG reductions and policy costs (Bhardwaj et al., 2022a).\n\n<a id='144c8dd0-a3f4-4b96-9345-10ecea7fb300'></a>\n\nAlthough we emphasize forward-looking quantitative modeling, the development of these models requires further data collection and sophisticated analyses of past LCFS-related polices. This includes analyses of consumer and market data, as well as investigation of any available data from industry. More research on the patterns of political support for and opposition to an LCFS from the fossil fuel and renewable fuel industries would be useful, as would further exploration of real and perceived equity impacts.\n\n<a id='3d59a206-dc1b-432d-b009-71eab403e40a'></a>\n\n## 5. Conclusions and policy implications\n\nThis review summarizes the available evidence for the role that a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS) can play in a policy mix seeking to achieve deep climate mitigation goals (e.g., net zero emissions by 2045 or 2050). We organize the insights across four broad policy evaluation criteria:\n\n1. Effectiveness (GHG mitigation): Research indicates that the LCFS policies in California, Oregon, and British Columbia have each helped to reduce GHG emissions to date, and forward-looking modeling indicates that a strong LCFS can play an additive role in a policy mix seeking deep GHG mitigation. However, complex sustainability impacts such as indirect land-use change (ILUC) require further research, and potentially more careful policy design. Relatedly, further research is needed understand how LCFS design can better focused on \"advanced\" rather than \"conventional\" biofuels.\n2. Efficiency: While it seems unlikely that an LCFS could be as efficient as a (technology-neutral) carbon price, research suggests that a well-designed LCFS can be a complement to a policy mix that includes carbon pricing or cap-and-trade. To improve LCFS efficiency, key\n\n<a id='8591404c-a2c0-4c91-ba46-0a1b4e8cf2ba'></a>\n\n61\n\n<a id='2cb855f9-9ddc-4d20-b7fa-ff5d9ba86085'></a>\n\nJ. Axsen and M.

However, little is known about equity impacts, or the influence of key stakeholders on policy development and implementation, notably fossil fuel companies, biofuel companies, and electric utilities.\n\n<a id='90fe3199-61c8-4f4a-a627-db7ef372ecd1'></a>\n\n4. **Transformative signal:** An LCFS seems to send a transformative market signal to the fuel suppliers operating in the regions covered by this type of policy. While it is difficult to prove causality, enactment of an LCFS is associated with increased development of new, more advanced low-carbon fuels. It seems likely that more stringent, credible, and longer-term LCFS can induce more substantial investment, innovation, and ultimately, technological change.\n\n<a id='39ad4f91-7191-4846-8709-5aeafa37b392'></a>\n\nFor now, while substantial uncertainty remains, we believe there is\nevidence that an LCFS can play a complementary role to policy mixes in\nmany regions. The policy receives high levels of citizen support (at least\nin North America), and can potentially induce additive technological\nchange by providing a technology push to fuel suppliers in particular.\nOngoing research will be needed to track the impacts of LCFS policies\naround the world, especially as these policies become more stringent,\nand to further clarify how an LCFS can be designed to maximize its\neffectiveness and efficiency.\n\n<a id='1a722d12-d8fd-4651-937d-fe45f000e4fc'></a>\n\n## Author contribution statement\n\nThe authors confirm contribution to the paper, where J.

California pioneered the LCFS in 2007, and versions have since been developed in other parts of North America, with LCFS-like policies emerging in Europe and Brazil. There is still relatively little research on the contribution that an LCFS can make to a climate policy mix. In this review, we summarize evidence and research gaps using a four-category interdisciplinary framework: effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, political acceptability, and transformative signal. First, regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, several studies demonstrate that existing LCFS policies have helped to cut emission to date, while modeling studies indicate that a stronger LCFS can play an additive mitigation role in a well-designed policy mix over the long-term. Second, policy cost-effectiveness is more uncertain; some studies suggests that although an LCFS is not likely to be as efficient as a carbon price, a well-designed LCFS could be an efficient complement to a mix that includes carbon pricing. Third is political and social acceptability, where numerous studies show that the LCFS receives substantial citizen support—more so than any pricing mechanism. Fourth is transformative signal, where the LCFS is associated with increased investment in low-carbon fuels and supportive infrastructure, and a stronger version could induce even more innovation in the long-term. We conclude by identifying research gaps, including the need to better understand the impacts of biofuels on indirect land-use and other sustainability measures, as well as improved simulation of longer-term technological change under a more stringent LCFS, including policy mix interactions.",

Introduction\n\nThis paper reviews evidence and identifies research gaps relating to the low-carbon carbon fuel standard (LCFS). An LCFS requires fuel suppliers to progressively decrease the average GHG intensity of their fuels on a life-cycle basis. The policy is based on the well-to-wheels \"carbon intensity\" of transport fuels, measured in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule (gCO2e/MJ). Life-cycle in this case refers to all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from fuel feedstock production, refining, distribution, and consumption—which is often termed \"well-to-wheels\" impacts. By definition, an LCFS is focused on well-to-wheel emissions and is not simply a mandate to blend in some proportion of biofuels into a region's liquid fuel mix (Farrell and Sperling, 2007b). The LCFS is meant to increase the uptake of low-carbon forms biofuels, as well as low-carbon forms of electricity- and hydrogen-powered transportation.",

An interdisciplinary framework for climate policy mixes\nThe design and evaluation of climate policy can be highly complex, especially when seeking to induce technological change and achieve deep decarbonization goals that are decades into a highly uncertain future. To organize insights and research gaps on the LCFS, we draw from Bhardwaj et al.'s (2020) interdisciplinary framework, which identifies four broad evaluation criteria based on a review of literature from several disciplines, including engineering, economics, policy studies, and innovations studies (Table 1).",

There is a broad body of research supporting the effectiveness and even necessity of policy mixes for energy and climate policy worldwide (Axsen et al., 2020; Bhardwaj et al., 2020; Kivimaa and Kern, 2016; Rogge et al., 2017). California in particular is well known for pioneering an effective policy mix for climate goals in the transport sector, addressing all three \"legs of the stool\": reduced fuel carbon intensity (including the LCFS), increased vehicle fuel efficiency, and reduced travel demand (vehicle km travelled) (Brown et al., 2021; Sperling and Eggert, 2014). There is inevitably some overlap in coverage and impact among policies, but in some cases that may desirable - with the goal of sending a clear and strong signal to industry, stakeholders, and society that the low-carbon transition is underway. Analyses of California and Canada suggest that the most effective and politically acceptable climate policies for transportation will include some mix of strong regulation and pricing (Axsen et al., 2020; Purdon et al., 2021)—a combination that could lead to a more cost-effective solution than regulations alone (Bhardwaj et al., 2022b).",

We note that globally there is an emerging distinction between conventional and \"advanced\" biofuels that accounts for both GHG and other sustainability criteria. Conventional biofuels—notably corn, sugarcane, and soybeans—use food-based crops, compete for land with food, and can have a wide range of lifecycle GHG emissions impacts (IEA, 2021e). In contrast, advanced biofuels are defined as fuels that (IEA, 2021e, p205):\ni) deliver significant lifecycle GHG reductions compared to the fossil fuels they are replacing, ii) are produced from non-food crop feedstocks, iii) do not directly compete for land with food or feed crops, and iv) do not cause other adverse sustainability or biodiversity impacts. Advanced feedstocks made up 7% of global biofuel production in 2020, and the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario assumes an increase to 45% by 2030 (IEA, 2021). However, as we will identify in this review, there is currently relatively less research on how an LCFS can induce advanced biofuel uptakes, as well as LCFS impacts to co-benefits, such as air pollution, land-use, and other sustainability impacts.",

Notably, citizen and stakeholder support or opposition regarding a policy or policy mix can play a critical role in the implementation (or not) of the policy (Justen et al., 2014; Rogge et al., 2017). Our definition considers acceptability by citizens (or the public), which can be assessed by surveys of representative samples (Eriksson et al., 2008; Rhodes et al., 2017). An international meta-analysis finds that citizen support for climate pricing and related policies is most strongly related to their perceptions of equity impacts (or fairness) and effectiveness in reducing emissions (Bergquist et al., 2022). Social support is also strongly influence by trust in the governing institutions (Bergquist et al., 2022), especially their trust in policymaker \"competence\" (Kitt et al., 2021). Political acceptability also includes the perceptions (and political clout) of special interest groups, such as oil companies, electric utilities, and biofuel companies.",

Of course, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of a given policy in contributing to GHG emissions reductions. Though that analysis alone is incomplete. Further, most regulations or pricing can be highly effective, if the stringency is high enough. The limiter for stringency might not be set by technical constraints, but by constraints set according to political acceptability or cost-effectiveness. So, a stringent policy might be effective, but might have low cost-effectiveness, or low political acceptability. In contrast, a policy that does not do much to induce GHG reductions might have other values in a policy mix, such as improving cost-effectiveness, political acceptability (via improved equity or other means), or transformative signal (including credibility). By considering all four categories of impact, we hope to avoid a simple diagnosis or dismissal of a particular policy—as the different impacts will vary by regional context, policy design, stringency, and interactions with the rest of a policy mix.",

Another detailed study on the production of ethanol in the US indicates that an LCFS incentivizes the uptake of less carbon intensive farming practices – changes that would not occur without the policy in place (Liu et al., 2020).

Another study used a dynamic model that integrates the US transport and agricultural sectors, finding that an LCFS could induce GHG reductions out to 2035 (the end of the model's time horizon), even when accounting for market feedbacks such as changes in fuel and food prices (Huang et al., 2013). Simulation modeling based in Canada found that an LCFS requiring a 15–20% reduction in carbon intensity of fuels could help the country to meet 2030 Paris Agreement targets, while an 80% reduction in carbon intensity could achieve 2050 GHG targets consistent with the Paris Agreement (Vass and Jaccard, 2017). A California-based modeling study simulated the impacts of a LCFS programs requiring 10%–25% reductions in fuel carbon intensity by 2030, finding that the policy can contribute to substantial additional GHG reductions, even with a policy mix that includes cap-and-trade (ICF, 2017).",

In all simulated scenarios, an LCFS results in greater GHG reductions when added to the policy mix.

Most of these studies do not consider the nuances of LCFS design, such as credit-trading, or whether the policy addresses electricity or only liquid fuels. More modeling is needed to understand the nature and degree of overlap across regulations, especially between a ZEV sales mandate and LCFS. Further, there is substantial uncertainty as to how an LCFS might induce technological change in low-carbon fuels (noted in the trans-formative change section below), as well as regarding low-carbon ve-hicles. Any simulation modeling of long-term LCFS impacts need to have detailed, endogenous representation of technological change (Azar and Dowlatabadi, 1999). We further address the criterion of transformative signal in Section 3.4. Finally, more research is needed to better under-stand the particular challenges that face the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sectors, including long-haul freight and various vocational uses.

Indeed, economists are often strongly or even solely focused on this criterion for policy evaluation. Cost-effectiveness for climate policy is typically considered according to the goal of minimizing GHG mitigation costs ($/per tonne CO2e), which typically is framed in terms of impacts to consumer surplus and industry profits. A broader perspective could consider other social welfare \"co-benefits\", such as impacts regarding traffic congestion, accidents, or air pollution (e.g., Small, 2012), as well as potential negative impacts, say from increased agricultural activity on erosion, habitat loss, crop prices, water pollution, and overall ecosystem services (Holland et al., 2015). Analyses might also consider impacts to overall economic activity (GDP) or jobs in a given sector, say through a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that accounts for intersectoral linkages. Simulating the policy interactions that determine cost-effectiveness can be even more challenging than simulating GHG impacts, as such analyses must account for uncertainties in the long-term dynamics of consumer and industry behaviour, as well as economic activity (Greene et al., 2016)— and in the case of biofuels, the complexities of agricultural activity.",

In some cases, earlier economic studies focused on such inefficiencies. For example, Holland et al. (2009) found that a national US LCFS would have very high mitigation costs ($300 to $2300 per tonne). However, the analysis focused on a fairly weak, short-term LCFS (10% reductions in carbon intensity) without detailed representation of potential technological change. A later study found an LCFS to be much more costly than cap-and-trade system (Holland et al., 2015), though again the analysis focused on a 10% LCFS only, and representations of technological change focused on conventional and cellulosic ethanol, without explicit representation of low-carbon electricity, hydrogen, or alternatives to diesel.",

Some studies suggest that an LCFS can have similar efficiency as a carbon price, if both policies are designed to achieve the same relatively large reduction in emissions. A modelling analysis of a carbon tax and the LCFS in California demonstrated that each policy caused the same change in societal welfare when designed to reduce annual emissions by more than 20 MtCO2e/yr (roughly 5% of California's current emissions) (Scheitrum, 2020). When both policies are equally stringent, this study suggests that they ultimately incentivize the same abatement actions. Similarly, another modelling study comparing a carbon price and LCFS (that achieve the same GHG goal) found that both policies produced very similar changes in vehicle technologies and fuel consumption (Vass and Jaccard, 2017), and thus, presumably similar changes in welfare impacts. For example, by 2050, 75–80% of light-duty vehicles use",

In particular, the compliance flexibility and cost containment mechanisms of LCFS policies can help to control compliance costs, and also help to mimic the compliance actions of a carbon price. For example, a credit cost ceiling (so called \"safety valve\" credits which can be purchased from the government at a fixed price) is argued to be important to align the cost-effectiveness of an LCFS with a comparably strong carbon price (Scheitrum, 2020).",

For example, a multi-model study of a hypothetical US-wide LCFS indicated that these mechanisms can reduce the average cost of compliance by about 7% (Rubin and Leiby, 2013), though the impact can be much greater depending on differences in compliance costs in the gasoline and diesel pool and the availability of safety valve credits. In an extreme case, when compliance for one fuel pool is much more expensive than for the other and there are limited safety valve credits, trading and banking can reduce average compliance costs by more than 85% (Rubin and Leiby, 2013). Credit trading between regions can similarly reduce compliance costs if an LCFS is applied across multiple regions with different abatement costs (Rubin et al., 2014).",

While it can be challenging to directly compare an LCFS versus pricing mechanism, it seems more likely that the efficiency of an LCFS can potentially be improved if one or more pricing mechanism is included in the policy mix. Dimanchev and Knittel (2020) suggests that the combination of a modest carbon price with market-oriented regulation is more efficient than the regulation alone. Specifically, setting up the policy mix such that the carbon price (e.g. cap and trade) achieves roughly 20–25% of the overall GHG abatement reduces the cost of achieving GHG targets by 40–70%, relative to using the regulation alone. The modest carbon price incentivizes the use of low-cost GHG reduction actions that are outside the scope of the regulation. Meanwhile, the more stringent regulation achieves the desired quantity of GHG abatement. Although their paper focused on a general renewable energy standard, the lead author confirmed that the result is also true for the case of an LCFS (personal communication). Modeling in California similarly suggests that the addition of an LCFS to a complex policy mix (including cap-and-trade) leads to some complementarity in terms of GHG compliance costs (ICF, 2017). Similar results regarding the complementarity of pricing mechanisms and regulations have been found for fuel economy standards (Small, 2012).",

Political acceptability\n\nPolitical acceptability is a particularly important, and often under-appreciated, component of real-world policy analysis. Even if a climate policy is shown to be effective and efficient, it is not likely to be implemented if policymakers perceive it will be rejected by citizens and key stakeholders. Here we focus on research on citizen acceptance of the LCFS in North American regions. Numerous studies have shown that market-oriented regulations such as the LCFS are more widely supported by the public than carbon pricing policies (Rhodes et al., 2014, 2015). A 2013 Canadian survey found that support was much higher for the LCFS",

The implication is that adding an LCFS to a policy mix is likely to be less politically risky than implementing a comparably effective or stringent carbon price. Though, there is more to learn about citizen perceptions of an LCFS, including how support or opposition relates to perceptions of equity impacts, effectiveness, and trust in policymakers and other stakeholders (Bergquist et al., 2022).",

Studies of stakeholder support, opposition and impacts on an LCFS are missing from the literature. Oil companies, biofuel companies, and electric utilities in particular have interests in an LCFS. We are not aware of any research on their potential influence in policy design. Drawing from other regulations, it has been found that automaker resistance has played a large role in changes to the design of California's ZEV mandate (Dyerson and Pilkington, 2005; Raux, 2004; Wesseling et al., 2014). It is likely that oil and biofuel companies can have similar impacts in regions that consider an LCFS. Further research could explore the recent behaviour of such stakeholders in regions that implement or reject an LCFS.",

However, this criterion is difficult to anticipate and analyze. The goal is for a policy mix to send a strong and durable signal, which occurs if the policies in the mix have a clear schedule of requirements over time (ideally over decades), with credible and stringent penalties for non-compliance (Nemet et al., 2017; Yeh et al., 2016). Because of the market predictability and \"push\" of the policy, a strong and credible LCFS can potentially improve the effectiveness of other policies (such as the cap and trade, carbon tax, vehicle emissions standard, or ZEV mandate) by giving more confidence for investments in low-carbon fuel supply, which leads to more supply (and potentially lower-cost supply) in the long-run.",

However, the question of additive impact is still difficult to answer. It is hard to prove causality and net impact: does an LCFS lead to additive investment, development and deployment of low-carbon fuels that would not otherwise have been produced? And when an LCFS is in place only in some regions, does it lead to \"shuffling\" of relatively low-carbon fuels to the regulated region, and higher-carbon fuels to regions with less regulation (Bento et al., 2015)? As with Section 3.1 on effectiveness, evidence can be drawn from past observation and from forward-looking models—though important research gaps remain. Overall, we find some evidence that the presence of the LCFS in a region is linked to the reduced carbon intensities of biofuels sold in the region, deployment of a wider variety of lower-carbon fuels, and electric utility support for electric vehicles.",

More transformation has been observed in the diesel pool, where biofuels blended with diesel in California (or as a substitute for diesel) accounted for 0.3% of diesel energy consumption at the start of 2011 rising to 40% by the end of 2021. There have been particularly large increases in renewable diesel and renewable natural gas, which were not available in those regions before an LCFS was implemented. Annual consumption of these fuels has been growing at 87% per year and 60% per year, respectively (Fig. 4). These two new biofuels supplied 59% of compliance credits in California 2021) (CARB, 2022b). In LCFS regions, landfill gas has made up an increasing proportion of natural gas feedstocks, while renewable diesel is mostly produced from corn oil, fish oil, tallow, or used cooking oil (Mazzone et al., 2021). Modelling supports the finding that an LCFS has been \"vital to the development of biomethane\" (p.292), making it cost competitive with fossil natural gas (Von Wald et al., 2019).",

First, the LCFS appears to be supporting investment in ethanol production with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Starting in 2020, ethanol with CCS was recognized as a fuel pathway within the California LCFS (California Air Resources Board, 2020b), coinciding with additional funding being directed towards this technology (e.g., North Dakota Industrial Commission, 2020). Analysis suggests that LCFS credits could induce much more uptake of ethanol with CCS production throughout the US (Sanchez et al., 2018). Second, the value of LCFS carbon credits is forecasted to encourage more production of lower-carbon biofuels made from cellulosic feedstocks (Hu and Chen, 2019), which could lead to additive GHG reductions (Huang et al., 2013). Third, a spatial analysis of corn and soy production indicates that the observed reductions in ethanol carbon intensity may be the result of farming practices responding to a market signal for lower-carbon biofuels (Liu et al., 2020). Specifically, conservation tilling, use of cover crops, and more efficient use of fertilizer can substantially reduce the carbon intensity of both ethanol and biodiesel relative to a typical corn/soy crop rotation (by 30–50 gCO2e/MJ) (Liu et al., 2020).",

This mechanism produces an incentive for electric utilities to further support PEV deployment. In California, electric utilities are required to use their credit revenue to support current or future PEV customers. Several utilities have opted to provide PEV purchase rebates, valued between $500 and $1500 per PEV (CARB, 2020). Though, it is quite difficult to isolate the impacts of such LCFS-inspired actions from the many other PEV-supportive policies in place in a given region, including other purchase incentives, carbon pricing, and vehicle regulations.",

As noted earlier, the ICCT finds that a nation-wide US LCFS requiring 20–30% reductions in carbon intensity will mostly favour further development of conventional, food-based biofuels, which would only increase ILUC emissions accordingly (ICCT, 2022). An implication of this finding is that a technology-neutral LCFS of this stringency would not be strong enough to induce substantial innovation in alternative and waste based biofuels (ICCT, 2022). As we argued earlier, more forward-looking modeling effort is needed to simulate the potential long-term, transformative impacts of a more stringent LCFS, especially when implemented with a suite of complementary climate policies.",

One promising sign is that most of North America is now subject to fuel blending mandates that account for carbon intensity in some way, meaning there are fewer places to \"dump\" high-carbon intensity biofuels. This includes the US Renewable Fuel Standard (US EPA, 2020), and sub-national blending mandates in Can-ada, for example in Alberta and Ontario (Government of Ontario, 2020; Province of Alberta, 2010). However, researchers and forward-looking models need to more carefully explore the interactions of LCFS policy across different countries and regions globally, which could include both shuffling of dirty fuels, as well as some innovation spillovers in bringing down the costs of new low-carbon fuel feedstocks.",

Modeling efforts suggest that an LCFS can induce more innovation in low-carbon fuels, if suitably stringent, and depending on how other complex impacts are treated in the policy design, notably ILUC. However, it is difficult to causally link an LCFS to observed technological change, or to calculate net GHG impacts across regions. An even more challenging task is to simulate the future, long-term impacts of a significantly more stringent LCFS on technological change.",

Research gaps\n\nOur summaries above (and Table 1) have identified numerous research gaps, where in general the LCFS is surprisingly understudied in the literature. Given the importance of the deep GHG reduction and decarbonization targets flowing from the Paris Agreement, and the enormous challenge of achieving net zero emissions (IEA, 2021), we place particular emphasis on the need for more forward-looking quantitative simulation modeling exercises. These models are needed to help understand and anticipate the many long-term dynamics that can be induced by a strong LCFS, including endogenous technology change (e. g., learning-by-doing and the emerging of new low-carbon technologies), changes in consumer preferences, and other market dynamics for various transportation fuels that are expected to play a strong role in deep decarbonization scenarios, notably low-carbon electricity, green hydrogen and advanced biofuels (IEA, 2021).",

More quantitative policy interaction studies are slowly emerging, but they still typically omit explicit modeling of an LCFS (e.g., Axsen et al., 2022a; Bhardwaj et al., 2022b; Lam and Mercure, 2021). Particular attention might be paid to certain types of policy overlap, such as the additive impact of an LCFS in the presence of a strong ZEV sales mandate, for example to address the question: is an LCFS needed if a strong ZEV mandate is already in place? Relatedly, questions of fuel \"shuffling\" across subnational regions or across the globe need to be addressed with spatially explicit models.",

The GHG emission and other sustainability impacts of ILUC are of particular concern, and require more research and dis-cussion to inform LCFS design (Lark et al., 2022). For example, it is unclear if ILUC values should lead to higher carbon intensity factors for certain fuels, or if a \"cap\" should be set for the usage of conventional, crop-based fuels (ICCT, 2022). Such nuance tends to be overlooked in modeling literature on climate regulations, but the design features of climate regulations have been shown to make an importance difference in GHG reductions and policy costs (Bhardwaj et al., 2022a).",

Conclusions and policy implications\n\nThis review summarizes the available evidence for the role that a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS) can play in a policy mix seeking to achieve deep climate mitigation goals (e.g., net zero emissions by 2045 or 2050). We organize the insights across four broad policy evaluation criteria:\n\n1. Effectiveness (GHG mitigation): Research indicates that the LCFS policies in California, Oregon, and British Columbia have each helped to reduce GHG emissions to date, and forward-looking modeling indicates that a strong LCFS can play an additive role in a policy mix seeking deep GHG mitigation. However, complex sustainability impacts such as indirect land-use change (ILUC) require further research, and potentially more careful policy design. Relatedly, further research is needed understand how LCFS design can better focused on \"advanced\" rather than \"conventional\" biofuels.\n2. Efficiency: While it seems unlikely that an LCFS could be as efficient as a (technology-neutral) carbon price, research suggests that a well-designed LCFS can be a complement to a policy mix that includes carbon pricing or cap-and-trade. To improve LCFS efficiency, key",

California pioneered the LCFS in 2007, and versions have since been developed in other parts of North America, with LCFS-like policies emerging in Europe and Brazil. There is still relatively little research on the contribution that an LCFS can make to a climate policy mix. In this review, we summarize evidence and research gaps using a four-category interdisciplinary framework: effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, political acceptability, and transformative signal. First, regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, several studies demonstrate that existing LCFS policies have helped to cut emission to date, while modeling studies indicate that a stronger LCFS can play an additive mitigation role in a well-designed policy mix over the long-term. Second, policy cost-effectiveness is more uncertain; some studies suggests that although an LCFS is not likely to be as efficient as a carbon price, a well-designed LCFS could be an efficient complement to a mix that includes carbon pricing. Third is political and social acceptability, where numerous studies show that the LCFS receives substantial citizen support—more so than any pricing mechanism. Fourth is transformative signal, where the LCFS is associated with increased investment in low-carbon fuels and supportive infrastructure, and a stronger version could induce even more innovation in the long-term. We conclude by identifying research gaps, including the need to better understand the impacts of biofuels on indirect land-use and other sustainability measures, as well as improved simulation of longer-term technological change under a more stringent LCFS, including policy mix interactions.\n\n<a id='1b8aa9d7-718e-4303-ac1e-067a97bb8971'></a>\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nThis paper reviews evidence and identifies research gaps relating to the low-carbon carbon fuel standard (LCFS). An LCFS requires fuel suppliers to progressively decrease the average GHG intensity of their fuels on a life-cycle basis. The policy is based on the well-to-wheels \"carbon intensity\" of transport fuels, measured in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule (gCO2e/MJ). Life-cycle in this case refers to all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from fuel feedstock production, refining, distribution, and consumption—which is often termed \"well-to-wheels\" impacts. By definition, an LCFS is focused on well-to-wheel emissions and is not simply a mandate to blend in some proportion of biofuels into a region's liquid fuel mix (Farrell and Sperling, 2007b). The LCFS is meant to increase the uptake of low-carbon forms biofuels, as well as low-carbon forms of electricity- and hydrogen-powered transportation.\n\n<a id='b7a73605-72b4-4c6e-a0a8-ff0757b2af87'></a>\n\nCalifornia pioneered the LCFS in 2007, which has since become part\nof an overall effort to achieve deep decarbonization goals, notably car-\nbon neutrality by 2045 (CARB, 2022a). In part, the LCFS was developed\nas a reaction to the US national biofuel blending mandate, which\nrequired usage of biofuels, but initially did not differentiate biofuels\nbased on the carbon intensity of their different feedstocks and produc-\ntion methods (Yeh et al., 2016). The original California LCFS required\nfuel suppliers to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold\nin the state by 10% by 2020, and it has since been extended to require a\nreduction of 20% by 2030.\n\n<a id='5c6ed9b9-3646-4768-9b5b-834cd4026814'></a>\n\nVersions of an LCFS have also been enacted in the Canadian province\nof British Columbia (in 2011) and the state of Oregon (2016)—both now\nhave the same 2030 targets as California (Mazzone et al., 2021). An\nLCFS will take effect in Washington state as well as across Canada in\n2023.

They are regulations in the sense that there is a carbon intensity target (or limit) that fuel providers must comply with. The LCFS is also market-oriented in that fuel suppliers can trade and bank emission credits and can chose how they reduce the carbon intensity of the fuels they produce. The latter component is meant to improve the policy's technology-neutrality and cost-effectiveness (Farrell and Sperling, 2007a; Yeh et al., 2016), giving fuel suppliers a wide range of compliance options. As examples, fuel suppliers can comply through actions such as (California Air Resources Board, 2020a):\n\n<a id='9f1db989-f718-48a1-8289-ea21088abc9d'></a>\n\n• blending low-carbon renewable fuels with fossil fuels, including ethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, renewable jet fuel, and renewable naphtha;\n• supporting alternative fuel vehicles (and related infrastructure) using energy sources such as electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, and propane; or\n• reductions in carbon emissions along the petroleum supply chain by capturing and storing CO2, producing hydrogen from renewable resources (e.g. biomass), using innovating crude oil production methods (e.g. using renewable electricity for oil production), or making refinery process improvements (e.g. energy efficiency improvements, replacing gas turbines with electric motors).\n\n<a id='46e3c898-df44-4e20-8ee6-01513358b96f'></a>\n\nFuel suppliers can generate these credits themselves or they can buy excess credits from other fuel suppliers or third-party credit producers. Again, this credit-trading option is meant to improve the cost-effectiveness of the policy, encouraging more GHG mitigation to occur where it is lowest cost.\n\n<a id='c53b98a1-e4cb-417d-a212-d1b5f9f89d37'></a>\n\nThis paper summarizes evidence for the potential impacts of an LCFS\n\n<a id='75c612d9-c339-4597-b25a-b9c670074b8b'></a>\n\nas a climate policy.

An interdisciplinary framework for climate policy mixes\nThe design and evaluation of climate policy can be highly complex, especially when seeking to induce technological change and achieve deep decarbonization goals that are decades into a highly uncertain future. To organize insights and research gaps on the LCFS, we draw from Bhardwaj et al.'s (2020) interdisciplinary framework, which identifies four broad evaluation criteria based on a review of literature from several disciplines, including engineering, economics, policy studies, and innovations studies (Table 1).\n\n<a id='9978571d-e89b-43e1-bc2e-20a0c8a154db'></a>\n\nTo start, this framework considers the LCFS as part of a policy mix. There is a broad body of research supporting the effectiveness and even necessity of policy mixes for energy and climate policy worldwide (Axsen et al., 2020; Bhardwaj et al., 2020; Kivimaa and Kern, 2016; Rogge et al., 2017). California in particular is well known for pioneering an effective policy mix for climate goals in the transport sector, addressing all three \"legs of the stool\": reduced fuel carbon intensity (including the LCFS), increased vehicle fuel efficiency, and reduced travel demand (vehicle km travelled) (Brown et al., 2021; Sperling and Eggert, 2014). There is inevitably some overlap in coverage and impact among policies, but in some cases that may desirable - with the goal of sending a clear and strong signal to industry, stakeholders, and society that the low-carbon transition is underway. Analyses of California and Canada suggest that the most effective and politically acceptable climate policies for transportation will include some mix of strong regulation and pricing (Axsen et al., 2020; Purdon et al., 2021)—a combination that could lead to a more cost-effective solution than regulations alone (Bhardwaj et al., 2022b).\n\n<a id='a1e80622-a843-4999-8a90-d8d579fc7754'></a>\n\nOur four-category interdisciplinary framework considers the various\nsocietal motivations for adding another policy to the mix (Table 1).

In this paper, we focus on the ability of the LCFS to induce incremental reductions in GHG emissions from the transportation sector, from a well-to-wheels perspective. Several published studies explore the LCFS from this perspective, without considering the other criteria noted below. A particularly important question is how stringent the LCFS needs to be in order help a policy mix to achieve deep GHG emissions mitigation goals.\n\n<a id='06a11566-8db3-4831-8599-6f588b18eb73'></a>\n\nOther societal impacts of an LCFS have received less study. We note that globally there is an emerging distinction between conventional and \"advanced\" biofuels that accounts for both GHG and other sustainability criteria. Conventional biofuels—notably corn, sugarcane, and soybeans—use food-based crops, compete for land with food, and can have a wide range of lifecycle GHG emissions impacts (IEA, 2021e). In contrast, advanced biofuels are defined as fuels that (IEA, 2021e, p205):\ni) deliver significant lifecycle GHG reductions compared to the fossil fuels they are replacing, ii) are produced from non-food crop feedstocks, iii) do not directly compete for land with food or feed crops, and iv) do not cause other adverse sustainability or biodiversity impacts. Advanced feedstocks made up 7% of global biofuel production in 2020, and the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario assumes an increase to 45% by 2030 (IEA, 2021). However, as we will identify in this review, there is currently relatively less research on how an LCFS can induce advanced biofuel uptakes, as well as LCFS impacts to co-benefits, such as air pollution, land-use, and other sustainability impacts.\n\n<a id='0069a4bc-96c3-4cc4-990d-55f9c5696433'></a>\n\nThe second evaluation criterion is cost-effectiveness or efficiency,\nwhich is typically calculated as the social welfare costs of the GHG\nmitigation, represented as the $/tonne CO2e abated. These costs typi-\ncally include impacts to consumer surplus and producer surplus. Of\ncourse, there is some overlap with the first criterion, as an ineffective\npolicy is not going to be efficient. But there is also an important nuance\nin how policy costs relate to the degree of policy stringency—where\nmarginal cost per tonne CO₂e abated can only be used to compare effi-\nciency between similarly stringent policies. Clearly an LCFS leading to\ngreater emissions reductions would also have a higher marginal cost\nthan a much less stringent policy, but that does not demonstrate that the\nLCFS is less efficient. Finally, cost-effectiveness analyses are inherently\nchallenging in the context of complexity—with multiple policies that\ninteract, potentially over decades to induce substantial innovation and\ntransformative change.\n\n<a id='77f56df9-3e34-4aba-b7ae-b8424a8e60ae'></a>\n\nThird is political acceptability, which is largely drawn from policy studies and considers the real-world aspects of politics that are often neglected in studies that focus purely on GHG mitigation or economic efficiency (Rosenbloom et al., 2020). Notably, citizen and stakeholder support or opposition regarding a policy or policy mix can play a critical role in the implementation (or not) of the policy (Justen et al., 2014; Rogge et al., 2017). Our definition considers acceptability by citizens (or the public), which can be assessed by surveys of representative samples (Eriksson et al., 2008; Rhodes et al., 2017). An international meta-analysis finds that citizen support for climate pricing and related policies is most strongly related to their perceptions of equity impacts (or fairness) and effectiveness in reducing emissions (Bergquist et al., 2022). Social support is also strongly influence by trust in the governing institutions (Bergquist et al., 2022), especially their trust in policymaker \"competence\" (Kitt et al., 2021). Political acceptability also includes the perceptions (and political clout) of special interest groups, such as oil companies, electric utilities, and biofuel companies.\n\n<a id='971318ae-1ac5-4b0c-bab9-f61e3516eb98'></a>\n\nOur final criterion is transformative signal which draws from the disciplines of innovations studies and sociotechnical systems (Geels, 2002; Weber and Rohracher, 2012). This criterion is likely to be especially important in the context of strong, long-term societal goals, such as achieving net-zero GHG emissions within 25–30 years. Technological change is a complex and dynamic process, involving interactions across many actors in the system (Foxon and Pearson, 2008; Rosenbloom et al., 2020; Weber and Rohracher, 2012). Therefore, moving away from the status quo of conventional fossil fuels involves a wide array of social, technological, institutional, and infrastructural challenges.\n\n<a id='66788704-4e0e-4442-820e-527633f897a0'></a>\n\nConsequently, the addition of a policy to a policy mix can be worthwhile\nif it improves the credibility of the transition, and thus stimulates the\nneeded transformation (Nemet et al., 2017). This transformative signal\ncan be improved by the inclusion of more stringent policies, and those\nwith longer-time horizons—even if there is some overlap in those pol-\nicies in terms of GHG mitigation effectiveness. The strength of signal can\nalso relate to technological specificity, where for example a carbon price\nmight be too technology-neutral to overcome the barrier of R&D spill-\nover effects that supress innovation (Azar and Sandén, 2011; Lehmann,\n\n<a id='ecafc1f7-23da-4686-80a1-36ed48eb54b6'></a>\n\n2012). Therefore, technology-pushing regulations might prove complementarity to pricing by inducing more technological change in the long-run (Jaffe et al., 2005).\n\n<a id='23fe6645-6ac3-481d-96ba-d36324ad76df'></a>\n\nHowever, it can be difficult to isolate and measure transformation\nand transformative signal, and to establish causality between the policy\nand the transformation activities. Potential measures include innovation\nactivity, such as increased investment in low-carbon biofuels, the\nemergence of new types of biofuel feedstock and production methods,\nand increases support for low-carbon fuels, vehicles, and supporting\ninfrastructure (Axsen et al., 2022b; Bhardwaj et al., 2020). An added\nchallenge is that LCFS policies in existence have mostly focused on\nmarginal GHG reduction goals (10–20% reductions in fuel carbon in-\ntensity), where a more stringent, long-term LCFS could lead to sub-\nstantially different R&D investment and innovation strategies.\nTransformative signal can also include improvements in institutional\ncapacity, including the development of the organizations and processes\nneeded to increase the uptake of low-carbon fuels.\n\n<a id='7f8fc9f0-9137-472d-8bfe-dfc6718ffe8d'></a>\n\nWe believe that explicit recognition of these four criteria, and the potential trade-offs among them, can improve evaluation and dialogue relating to climate policies within the context of a real-world policy mix. Of course, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of a given policy in contributing to GHG emissions reductions. Though that analysis alone is incomplete. Further, most regulations or pricing can be highly effective, if the stringency is high enough. The limiter for stringency might not be set by technical constraints, but by constraints set according to political acceptability or cost-effectiveness. So, a stringent policy might be effective, but might have low cost-effectiveness, or low political acceptability. In contrast, a policy that does not do much to induce GHG reductions might have other values in a policy mix, such as improving cost-effectiveness, political acceptability (via improved equity or other means), or transformative signal (including credibility). By considering all four categories of impact, we hope to avoid a simple diagnosis or dismissal of a particular policy—as the different impacts will vary by regional context, policy design, stringency, and interactions with the rest of a policy mix.\n\n<a id='c2d91357-0f23-4a65-8453-132a5b969b58'></a>\n\nTable 1 summarizes these four policy mix evaluation criteria, along\nwith potential quantitative measures. We have attempted to include all\navailable peer-reviewed literature on this policy via searches of various\ndatabases, as well as relevant grey-literature. Our interpretations\nconsider both the quality and quantity of published studies. The two\ncolumns on the right summarizes the evidence and research gaps that we\nidentify in this paper.\n\n<a id='3b86435c-0908-4b8b-b18a-e2640bc17935'></a>\n\n## 3. Evidence for the LCFS\n\n### 3.1. *Effectiveness at GHG mitigation*\n\nWe consider two broad categories of evidence regarding the effectiveness of an LCFS in terms of reducing GHG emissions. Some studies focus on data from the past, say, for a region that implemented the policy. Analysts then use statistical analysis to identify the additive impact of the policy. This approach is based in real-world data and can provide useful insight, though doesn't provide a complete picture of potential future impacts and system dynamics. A second broad category of research uses forward-looking models (ideally with some empirical basis for their parameters) to anticipate the long-term impacts of a climate policy. In particular, a strong climate policy might induce\n\n<a id='edc4974a-304a-4e50-bb72-52f406267eff'></a>\n\n56",

One study used three different statistical analysis (econometric techniques) to find “robust evidence” that the LCFS reduced California’s transport GHG emissions by around 10% (controlling for other climate policies in place), compared to a counterfactual scenario with no LCFS (Huseynov and Palma, 2018). Another detailed study on the production of ethanol in the US indicates that an LCFS incentivizes the uptake of less carbon intensive farming practices – changes that would not occur without the policy in place (Liu et al., 2020). Recent assessments of the LCFS in California, Oregon, and British Columbia indicates that all three policies have achieved their carbon intensity requirements (Mazzone et al., 2021).\n\n<a id='a5177b05-bbe0-462b-9e13-730aff15d813'></a>\n\nSeveral studies use forward-looking simulation models to estimate the potential impacts of an LCFS out to 2030 and 2050. For example, some early modeling in California indicated that the LCFS would be responsible for about 20% of the GHG reductions in the transport sector by 2050 (Bedsworth et al., 2011). Another study used a dynamic model that integrates the US transport and agricultural sectors, finding that an LCFS could induce GHG reductions out to 2035 (the end of the model's time horizon), even when accounting for market feedbacks such as changes in fuel and food prices (Huang et al., 2013). Simulation modeling based in Canada found that an LCFS requiring a 15–20% reduction in carbon intensity of fuels could help the country to meet 2030 Paris Agreement targets, while an 80% reduction in carbon intensity could achieve 2050 GHG targets consistent with the Paris Agreement (Vass and Jaccard, 2017). A California-based modeling study simulated the impacts of a LCFS programs requiring 10%–25% reductions in fuel carbon intensity by 2030, finding that the policy can contribute to substantial additional GHG reductions, even with a policy mix that includes cap-and-trade (ICF, 2017).\n\n<a id='4dbfb494-6afc-4c93-a53d-605044d8b853'></a>\n\nHere we provide a more detailed explanation of one particular published modeling study (Lepitzki and Axsen, 2018). The study is unique in that it explores the role of an LCFS in the context of deep GHG emissions reductions in the long-term (2050), while considering a full suite of policy mixes, and including endogenous modeling of technological changes as well as dynamics in consumer preferences (summarized elsewhere, e.g., Axsen et al., 2009; Horne et al., 2005; Jaccard, 2009). The authors simulated several policy scenarios, with different levels of an LCFS as follows.\n\n<a id='2bb564ac-393d-4c3d-8eb9-49b8fc4b6607'></a>\n\n• \"Ref\": the original LCFS requiring 10% reduction in lifecycle carbon intensity\n• \"Low\": requiring 25% reduction in carbon intensity\n• \"Medium\": requiring 40% reduction in carbon intensity\n• \"High\": requiring 75% reduction in carbon intensity\n\n<a id='6915e6ec-871d-4ac5-894e-31cbcef12d75'></a>\n\nThe scenarios include several stringencies of other policy mixes.\n\n* \"Weak\" policy package: $30/tonne carbon tax, fuel efficiency standards (CAFE) reducing vehicle consumption by 34%, and zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate requiring that 14% of vehicle sales be ZEVs.\n* \"Moderate\" policy package: carbon tax increasing to $118/tonne, CAFE/fuel efficiency standards reducing vehicle consumption by 57%, and ZEV mandate requiring that 65% of vehicle sales be ZEVs.\n* \"Ambitious\" policy package: carbon tax increasing to $350/tonne, CAFE/fuel efficiency standards reducing vehicle consumption by 65%, and ZEV mandate requiring that 100% of vehicle sales be ZEVs.\n\n<a id='5729e53a-cd38-4ac2-b6ef-17953429c891'></a>\n\nAs summarized in Fig. 1, this study finds that when combined with other stringent policies (including carbon pricing), a strong LCFS could be responsible for about 12–20% of the GHG reductions from 2007 levels by 2050 (Lepitzki and Axsen, 2018). In all simulated scenarios, an LCFS results in greater GHG reductions when added to the policy mix. That same study found that the additive effects of the LCFS could be particularly strong in the freight sector (not shown), which has fewer and less stringent climate regulations in the baseline (and thus less overlap with other policies) than the passenger vehicle sector.\n\n<a id='594e5166-0094-49a5-96a3-797414ab3594'></a>\n\nAlthough these modeling studies indicate the potential promise of an LCFS, there are important limitations and omissions in the literature. Most of these studies do not consider the nuances of LCFS design, such as credit-trading, or whether the policy addresses electricity or only liquid fuels. More modeling is needed to understand the nature and degree of overlap across regulations, especially between a ZEV sales mandate and LCFS. Further, there is substantial uncertainty as to how an LCFS might induce technological change in low-carbon fuels (noted in the trans-formative change section below), as well as regarding low-carbon ve-hicles. Any simulation modeling of long-term LCFS impacts need to have detailed, endogenous representation of technological change (Azar and Dowlatabadi, 1999). We further address the criterion of transformative signal in Section 3.4. Finally, more research is needed to better under-stand the particular challenges that face the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sectors, including long-haul freight and various vocational uses. There is also uncertainty regarding how an LCFS treats indirect land-\n\n<a id='5cd44c54-f163-471c-8513-96c82098f299'></a>\n\n<::transcription of the content\n: line chart::>\nThis multi-panel line chart displays \"Total Transport\" WTW GHG Emissions (kt CO2e) on the left y-axis and \"% GHG Reduction from 2007\" on the right y-axis, over the years 2005 to 2050 on the x-axis.

The ICCT suggests that ILUC emissions can be mitigated by including a cap on the amount of food-based biofuels that can be used to comply with the LCFS (ICCT, 2022).\n\n<a id='de1b3578-3932-4dfb-b681-562a9f4bccdb'></a>\n\n3.2. Cost-effectiveness\n\nIn addition to being effective, some policymakers and stakeholders want a policy to be efficient. Indeed, economists are often strongly or even solely focused on this criterion for policy evaluation. Cost-effectiveness for climate policy is typically considered according to the goal of minimizing GHG mitigation costs ($/per tonne CO2e), which typically is framed in terms of impacts to consumer surplus and industry profits. A broader perspective could consider other social welfare \"co-benefits\", such as impacts regarding traffic congestion, accidents, or air pollution (e.g., Small, 2012), as well as potential negative impacts, say from increased agricultural activity on erosion, habitat loss, crop prices, water pollution, and overall ecosystem services (Holland et al., 2015). Analyses might also consider impacts to overall economic activity (GDP) or jobs in a given sector, say through a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that accounts for intersectoral linkages. Simulating the policy interactions that determine cost-effectiveness can be even more challenging than simulating GHG impacts, as such analyses must account for uncertainties in the long-term dynamics of consumer and industry behaviour, as well as economic activity (Greene et al., 2016)— and in the case of biofuels, the complexities of agricultural activity.\n\n<a id='a400c6f0-02a4-4d93-a068-17b4d6ab742a'></a>\n\nA pricing mechanism is typically expected to be more efficient than an LCFS, mainly because pricing is technology-neutral and incentivizes the full range of compliance options (reduced carbon intensity of fuels, improved vehicle efficiency, and reduced travel/activity) - whereas an LCFS only focuses on fuel carbon intensity (gCO2e/MJ). In some cases, earlier economic studies focused on such inefficiencies. For example, Holland et al. (2009) found that a national US LCFS would have very high mitigation costs ($300 to $2300 per tonne). However, the analysis focused on a fairly weak, short-term LCFS (10% reductions in carbon intensity) without detailed representation of potential technological change. A later study found an LCFS to be much more costly than cap-and-trade system (Holland et al., 2015), though again the analysis focused on a 10% LCFS only, and representations of technological change focused on conventional and cellulosic ethanol, without explicit representation of low-carbon electricity, hydrogen, or alternatives to diesel.\n\n<a id='942be145-33ab-4ecf-89b1-a397f9afa5ac'></a>\n\nClearly, the efficiency of an LCFS will relate to its stringency. Some studies suggest that an LCFS can have similar efficiency as a carbon price, if both policies are designed to achieve the same relatively large reduction in emissions. A modelling analysis of a carbon tax and the LCFS in California demonstrated that each policy caused the same change in societal welfare when designed to reduce annual emissions by more than 20 MtCO2e/yr (roughly 5% of California's current emissions) (Scheitrum, 2020). When both policies are equally stringent, this study suggests that they ultimately incentivize the same abatement actions. Similarly, another modelling study comparing a carbon price and LCFS (that achieve the same GHG goal) found that both policies produced very similar changes in vehicle technologies and fuel consumption (Vass and Jaccard, 2017), and thus, presumably similar changes in welfare impacts. For example, by 2050, 75–80% of light-duty vehicles use\n\n<a id='24e4dd9c-a6e8-4d28-a239-c6ddec79ba85'></a>\n\nlow-carbon alternative fuels (electricity or E85), regardless of pricing or LCFS approach.\n\n<a id='90926813-2c39-4f53-873c-4eff8e0f727e'></a>\n\nPolicy costs will also be impacted by LCFS design. In particular, the compliance flexibility and cost containment mechanisms of LCFS policies can help to control compliance costs, and also help to mimic the compliance actions of a carbon price. For example, a credit cost ceiling (so called \"safety valve\" credits which can be purchased from the government at a fixed price) is argued to be important to align the cost-effectiveness of an LCFS with a comparably strong carbon price (Scheitrum, 2020).\n\n<a id='d06c5a54-ad73-4125-878b-023b639044ed'></a>\n\nCompliance costs can be further reduced through design features such as credit banking and credit trading. For example, a multi-model study of a hypothetical US-wide LCFS indicated that these mechanisms can reduce the average cost of compliance by about 7% (Rubin and Leiby, 2013), though the impact can be much greater depending on differences in compliance costs in the gasoline and diesel pool and the availability of safety valve credits. In an extreme case, when compliance for one fuel pool is much more expensive than for the other and there are limited safety valve credits, trading and banking can reduce average compliance costs by more than 85% (Rubin and Leiby, 2013). Credit trading between regions can similarly reduce compliance costs if an LCFS is applied across multiple regions with different abatement costs (Rubin et al., 2014).\n\n<a id='58d8bf94-e59f-40a7-bee3-2b0292006262'></a>\n\nFurther, the design of policy mix will also impact policy costs. While it can be challenging to directly compare an LCFS versus pricing mechanism, it seems more likely that the efficiency of an LCFS can potentially be improved if one or more pricing mechanism is included in the policy mix. Dimanchev and Knittel (2020) suggests that the combination of a modest carbon price with market-oriented regulation is more efficient than the regulation alone. Specifically, setting up the policy mix such that the carbon price (e.g. cap and trade) achieves roughly 20–25% of the overall GHG abatement reduces the cost of achieving GHG targets by 40–70%, relative to using the regulation alone. The modest carbon price incentivizes the use of low-cost GHG reduction actions that are outside the scope of the regulation. Meanwhile, the more stringent regulation achieves the desired quantity of GHG abatement. Although their paper focused on a general renewable energy standard, the lead author confirmed that the result is also true for the case of an LCFS (personal communication). Modeling in California similarly suggests that the addition of an LCFS to a complex policy mix (including cap-and-trade) leads to some complementarity in terms of GHG compliance costs (ICF, 2017). Similar results regarding the complementarity of pricing mechanisms and regulations have been found for fuel economy standards (Small, 2012).\n\n<a id='d047f1a6-1ceb-4c44-bc2a-a8fda1982978'></a>\n\nWhile these studies provide some insight, there is still considerable\nuncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of an LCFS, both in com-\nparison to other policy options (pricing and other regulations), and\nwhen implemented as part of a policy mix. More modeling research is\nneeded to anticipate the uncertain long-term costs of an LCFS, including\ndifferent stringency levels, and in different combinations with other\npolicies. Such modeling needs to tackle the challenges and uncertainties\nof modeling endogenous technological change (e.g., learning curves)\nand dynamics in consumer behaviour for both passenger and commer-\ncial users.\n\n<a id='8068eed6-7a63-4e05-b16f-7d84c7ceafdc'></a>\n\n### 3.3. Political acceptability\n\nPolitical acceptability is a particularly important, and often under-appreciated, component of real-world policy analysis. Even if a climate policy is shown to be effective and efficient, it is not likely to be implemented if policymakers perceive it will be rejected by citizens and key stakeholders. Here we focus on research on citizen acceptance of the LCFS in North American regions. Numerous studies have shown that market-oriented regulations such as the LCFS are more widely supported by the public than carbon pricing policies (Rhodes et al., 2014, 2015). A 2013 Canadian survey found that support was much higher for the LCFS\n\n<a id='8eab849d-942b-4bd2-b621-991832a20b75'></a>\n\n",

Further statistical analysis indicates that while carbon pricing is more opposed by those that rely on personal vehicles for commuting, support for the LCFS is independent of vehicle ownership or usage.\n\n<a id='39dc2f91-d8da-40fc-8f88-69dc2a55a82c'></a>\n\nSimilar results were found in a 2019 survey conducted with repre-sentative samples of citizens in California and Canada, where the ma-jority of respondents support an LCFS (Long et al., 2020). Support is high for this policy when it requires a 20% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030, and support remains high even for a much stronger version requiring an 80% reduction by 2050 (Long et al., 2020). Comparing policy instruments (Fig. 2), support for a strong vehicle emissions standard (CAFE) and LCFS is similarly high across regions (around 60%-80% support), with lower support for a strong ZEV mandate (34%-55% support), and significantly lower support for strong carbon pricing (22%-30%). Rates of opposition are particularly high for carbon pricing, ranging from 45% to 65% of respondents.\n\n<a id='38f16b4e-9702-4b83-9973-4c44c47a57ed'></a>\n\nIn short, among the policies assessed, in North America the LCFS is found to be one of the most highly supported climate policies by citizens. The implication is that adding an LCFS to a policy mix is likely to be less politically risky than implementing a comparably effective or stringent carbon price. Though, there is more to learn about citizen perceptions of an LCFS, including how support or opposition relates to perceptions of equity impacts, effectiveness, and trust in policymakers and other stakeholders (Bergquist et al., 2022).\n\n<a id='0786440b-3793-4a6d-b135-33767b343c01'></a>\n\nThat said, such measures of citizen support only account for one potential component of political acceptability. Studies of stakeholder support, opposition and impacts on an LCFS are missing from the literature. Oil companies, biofuel companies, and electric utilities in particular have interests in an LCFS. We are not aware of any research on their potential influence in policy design. Drawing from other regulations, it has been found that automaker resistance has played a large role in changes to the design of California's ZEV mandate (Dyerson and Pilkington, 2005; Raux, 2004; Wesseling et al., 2014). It is likely that oil and biofuel companies can have similar impacts in regions that consider an LCFS. Further research could explore the recent behaviour of such stakeholders in regions that implement or reject an LCFS.\n\n<a id='52b27f14-0361-4c57-a71b-aee41d4654b3'></a>\n\n3.4. Transformative signal\n\n<a id='733abab8-9886-4d84-b104-fe70461a2577'></a>\n\nAs noted, transformative signal is an important criterion for a policy mix that seeks to induce long term-technology change and deep GHG emissions mitigation. However, this criterion is difficult to anticipate and analyze. The goal is for a policy mix to send a strong and durable signal, which occurs if the policies in the mix have a clear schedule of requirements over time (ideally over decades), with credible and stringent penalties for non-compliance (Nemet et al., 2017; Yeh et al., 2016). Because of the market predictability and \"push\" of the policy, a strong and credible LCFS can potentially improve the effectiveness of other policies (such as the cap and trade, carbon tax, vehicle emissions standard, or ZEV mandate) by giving more confidence for investments in low-carbon fuel supply, which leads to more supply (and potentially lower-cost supply) in the long-run.\n\n<a id='335beca0-deee-4835-8992-a7e0a6f8f29e'></a>\n\nPotential indicators include evidence for additional R&D investment, provision of supportive physical infrastructure, breaking the \"lock-in\" of incumbent industry and technology, and providing \"directionality\" as to which direction the low-carbon transition may take (Bhardwaj et al., 2020). However, the question of additive impact is still difficult to answer. It is hard to prove causality and net impact: does an LCFS lead to additive investment, development and deployment of low-carbon fuels that would not otherwise have been produced? And when an LCFS is in place only in some regions, does it lead to \"shuffling\" of relatively low-carbon fuels to the regulated region, and higher-carbon fuels to regions with less regulation (Bento et al., 2015)? As with Section 3.1 on effectiveness, evidence can be drawn from past observation and from forward-looking models—though important research gaps remain. Overall, we find some evidence that the presence of the LCFS in a region is linked to the reduced carbon intensities of biofuels sold in the region, deployment of a wider variety of lower-carbon fuels, and electric utility support for electric vehicles.\n\n<a id='7ae21624-3e22-4e19-9bec-c507693a4fd1'></a>\n\nFirst, we consider some observations from existing policies, though this evidence is mostly limited to association rather than causality. Since implementing the LCFS, California has recorded substantial declines in the carbon intensities of first-generation biofuels. From 2011 through 2021, the carbon intensity of ethanol used in California declined by 29% and the carbon intensity of biodiesel fell by 36% (Fig. 3) (CARB, 2022b).\n\n<a id='3c3d7047-e813-4d30-85e2-d6a8083320a2'></a>\n\n<::Bar chart showing the percentage of respondents for different policy measures across various regions.\n\nLegend:\n- Strongly oppose (dark red)\n- Somewhat oppose (light red)\n- Somewhat support (light blue)\n- Strongly support (dark blue)\n\nX-axis: Percentage of respondents, ranging from -80% to 100%.\n\nY-axis categories and data:\n\n1.

It is difficult to determine how much of these reductions are due to new innovation activity versus fuel supplier \"shuffling\" of lower-carbon fuel sources to the LCFS regulated regions.\n\n<a id='69720e9f-4c26-4a99-92e6-b16ea02b4e57'></a>\n\nFurther, data from California, Oregon, and British Columbia show the LCFS is associated with increasing quantity and variety of low-carbon transportation fuels being developed and used in each region. More transformation has been observed in the diesel pool, where biofuels blended with diesel in California (or as a substitute for diesel) accounted for 0.3% of diesel energy consumption at the start of 2011 rising to 40% by the end of 2021. There have been particularly large increases in renewable diesel and renewable natural gas, which were not available in those regions before an LCFS was implemented. Annual consumption of these fuels has been growing at 87% per year and 60% per year, respectively (Fig. 4). These two new biofuels supplied 59% of compliance credits in California 2021) (CARB, 2022b). In LCFS regions, landfill gas has made up an increasing proportion of natural gas feedstocks, while renewable diesel is mostly produced from corn oil, fish oil, tallow, or used cooking oil (Mazzone et al., 2021). Modelling supports the finding that an LCFS has been \"vital to the development of biomethane\" (p.292), making it cost competitive with fossil natural gas (Von Wald et al., 2019).\n\n<a id='c9616943-6233-409f-91c2-bf63c1566558'></a>\n\nIt seems likely that consumption of renewable diesel will continue to\n\n<a id='2b41fb6e-e22c-4334-9b16-f1a375248843'></a>\n\ngrow. Notably, there have been major investments in renewable diesel production capacity in California and announcements of even more to come (Biomass Magazine, 2020; Bloomberg, 2020; Globenewswire, 2018; Marathon, 2020; Oil, 2020), with similar investments observed in British Columbia (Energy, 2019; Parkland, 2020).\n\n<a id='a693df1c-45b8-41dc-9b62-4406bfe5cd85'></a>\n\nAlthough there has been less innovation observed in the gasoline pool, where ethanol production continues to be dominated by corn and wheat feedstocks (Mazzone et al., 2021), there is nonetheless evidence that LCFS policies are driving innovation. First, the LCFS appears to be supporting investment in ethanol production with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Starting in 2020, ethanol with CCS was recognized as a fuel pathway within the California LCFS (California Air Resources Board, 2020b), coinciding with additional funding being directed towards this technology (e.g., North Dakota Industrial Commission, 2020). Analysis suggests that LCFS credits could induce much more uptake of ethanol with CCS production throughout the US (Sanchez et al., 2018). Second, the value of LCFS carbon credits is forecasted to encourage more production of lower-carbon biofuels made from cellulosic feedstocks (Hu and Chen, 2019), which could lead to additive GHG reductions (Huang et al., 2013). Third, a spatial analysis of corn and soy production indicates that the observed reductions in ethanol carbon intensity may be the result of farming practices responding to a market signal for lower-carbon biofuels (Liu et al., 2020). Specifically, conservation tilling, use of cover crops, and more efficient use of fertilizer can substantially reduce the carbon intensity of both ethanol and biodiesel relative to a typical corn/soy crop rotation (by 30–50 gCO2e/MJ) (Liu et al., 2020).\n\n<a id='7e36c335-c58f-4895-871d-8ecb19417926'></a>\n\n<::stacked bar chart\nY-axis: Diesel gallon equivalents per year (10^6)\nX-axis: Years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021\nLegend:\n- Renewable natural gas (bio-CNG and LNG) (represented by the bottom, darker portion of the bars)\n- Renewable diesel (represented by the top, lighter portion of the bars)\n\nData points (approximate values for total diesel gallon equivalents per year):\n- 2011: 0\n- 2012: 0\n- 2013: ~130 (Renewable natural gas: ~20, Renewable diesel: ~110)\n- 2014: ~140 (Renewable natural gas: ~30, Renewable diesel: ~110)\n- 2015: ~230 (Renewable natural gas: ~50, Renewable diesel: ~180)\n- 2016: ~350 (Renewable natural gas: ~80, Renewable diesel: ~270)\n- 2017: ~430 (Renewable natural gas: ~100, Renewable diesel: ~330)\n- 2018: ~500 (Renewable natural gas: ~120, Renewable diesel: ~380)\n- 2019: ~750 (Renewable natural gas: ~140, Renewable diesel: ~610)\n- 2020: ~740 (Renewable natural gas: ~150, Renewable diesel: ~590)\n- 2021: ~1100 (Renewable natural gas: ~180, Renewable diesel: ~920)\n\nAdditional text on chart:\n- +60%/yr growth in renewable natural gas\n- +87%/yr growth in renewable diesel\nAn upward arrow indicates the overall growth trend.\nFig. 4.

This mechanism produces an incentive for electric utilities to further support PEV deployment. In California, electric utilities are required to use their credit revenue to support current or future PEV customers. Several utilities have opted to provide PEV purchase rebates, valued between $500 and $1500 per PEV (CARB, 2020). Though, it is quite difficult to isolate the impacts of such LCFS-inspired actions from the many other PEV-supportive policies in place in a given region, including other purchase incentives, carbon pricing, and vehicle regulations.\n\n<a id='61e2ae91-0621-46c4-a139-ce1217087a31'></a>\n\nOf course, the transformative signal of an LCFS will depend on the stringency of the policy. As noted earlier, the ICCT finds that a nation-wide US LCFS requiring 20–30% reductions in carbon intensity will mostly favour further development of conventional, food-based biofuels, which would only increase ILUC emissions accordingly (ICCT, 2022). An implication of this finding is that a technology-neutral LCFS of this stringency would not be strong enough to induce substantial innovation in alternative and waste based biofuels (ICCT, 2022). As we argued earlier, more forward-looking modeling effort is needed to simulate the potential long-term, transformative impacts of a more stringent LCFS, especially when implemented with a suite of complementary climate policies.\n\n<a id='1d33d1c6-81dd-4135-95d0-2075f7dd12cc'></a>\n\nAnother uncertainty is the potential for \"shuffling\" high-carbon fuels to regions without an LCFS. One promising sign is that most of North America is now subject to fuel blending mandates that account for carbon intensity in some way, meaning there are fewer places to \"dump\" high-carbon intensity biofuels. This includes the US Renewable Fuel Standard (US EPA, 2020), and sub-national blending mandates in Can-ada, for example in Alberta and Ontario (Government of Ontario, 2020; Province of Alberta, 2010). However, researchers and forward-looking models need to more carefully explore the interactions of LCFS policy across different countries and regions globally, which could include both shuffling of dirty fuels, as well as some innovation spillovers in bringing down the costs of new low-carbon fuel feedstocks.\n\n<a id='254f67d0-39d2-4a30-83a0-31bb7e411e64'></a>\n\nIn summary, there is some evidence that regions with an LCFS (and regions that sell into an LCFS region) have an improved transformative signal such that there has been increased investment in low-carbon fuels. Modeling efforts suggest that an LCFS can induce more innovation in low-carbon fuels, if suitably stringent, and depending on how other complex impacts are treated in the policy design, notably ILUC. However, it is difficult to causally link an LCFS to observed technological change, or to calculate net GHG impacts across regions. An even more challenging task is to simulate the future, long-term impacts of a significantly more stringent LCFS on technological change.\n\n<a id='0943729b-cf16-4463-a638-ee841451e251'></a>\n\n## 4. Research gaps\n\nOur summaries above (and Table 1) have identified numerous research gaps, where in general the LCFS is surprisingly understudied in the literature. Given the importance of the deep GHG reduction and decarbonization targets flowing from the Paris Agreement, and the enormous challenge of achieving net zero emissions (IEA, 2021), we place particular emphasis on the need for more forward-looking quantitative simulation modeling exercises. These models are needed to help understand and anticipate the many long-term dynamics that can be induced by a strong LCFS, including endogenous technology change (e. g., learning-by-doing and the emerging of new low-carbon technologies), changes in consumer preferences, and other market dynamics for various transportation fuels that are expected to play a strong role in deep decarbonization scenarios, notably low-carbon electricity, green hydrogen and advanced biofuels (IEA, 2021).\n\n<a id='06ab69a1-505f-4a3d-ac17-65f6c4c0ab77'></a>\n\nThese quantitative simulations need to include time horizons out to\n2030 to 2050, while simulating much more stringent versions of the\nLCFS (and other policies) than have yet been implemented in the real-\nworld. A major challenge is that these models need to endogenously\n\n<a id='6219175d-9027-4bdb-83a0-88aa5494fc52'></a>\n\nsimulate the broader system, including behavior on the demand and\nsupply side. An LCFS can impact consumer decision about vehicle pur-\nchase and usage, including light-duty passenger vehicle, as well as the\noperators of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. It can be particularly\nchallenging to assess how the various fuel suppliers, including oil\ncompanies, biofuel companies, and electric utilities may behave in the\nlong-term in response to strong LCFS policy. Perhaps even more difficult\nis to anticipate how stakeholders in other sectors may react, such as\nvehicle manufacturers.\n\n<a id='20261cd6-756f-4992-865d-6b65499205c5'></a>\n\nFurther, such models need to more systematically simulate policy interactions, including the effectiveness, efficiency, and transformation impacts of an LCFS - when implemented in combination with forms of carbon pricing and other technology regulations (vehicle emissions standard and ZEV mandate), subsidies, and deployment of charging and fueling infrastructure. More quantitative policy interaction studies are slowly emerging, but they still typically omit explicit modeling of an LCFS (e.g., Axsen et al., 2022a; Bhardwaj et al., 2022b; Lam and Mercure, 2021). Particular attention might be paid to certain types of policy overlap, such as the additive impact of an LCFS in the presence of a strong ZEV sales mandate, for example to address the question: is an LCFS needed if a strong ZEV mandate is already in place? Relatedly, questions of fuel \"shuffling\" across subnational regions or across the globe need to be addressed with spatially explicit models.\n\n<a id='4ac14c93-c775-42d4-985c-9b43f2bd2d99'></a>\n\nFurther, there are many remaining questions about how to best design an LCFS, such as calculations of WTW emissions, treatment of electricity versus liquid fuels, credit banking and trading, and penalties for non-compliance. The GHG emission and other sustainability impacts of ILUC are of particular concern, and require more research and dis-cussion to inform LCFS design (Lark et al., 2022). For example, it is unclear if ILUC values should lead to higher carbon intensity factors for certain fuels, or if a \"cap\" should be set for the usage of conventional, crop-based fuels (ICCT, 2022). Such nuance tends to be overlooked in modeling literature on climate regulations, but the design features of climate regulations have been shown to make an importance difference in GHG reductions and policy costs (Bhardwaj et al., 2022a).\n\n<a id='144c8dd0-a3f4-4b96-9345-10ecea7fb300'></a>\n\nAlthough we emphasize forward-looking quantitative modeling, the development of these models requires further data collection and sophisticated analyses of past LCFS-related polices. This includes analyses of consumer and market data, as well as investigation of any available data from industry. More research on the patterns of political support for and opposition to an LCFS from the fossil fuel and renewable fuel industries would be useful, as would further exploration of real and perceived equity impacts.\n\n<a id='3d59a206-dc1b-432d-b009-71eab403e40a'></a>\n\n## 5. Conclusions and policy implications\n\nThis review summarizes the available evidence for the role that a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS) can play in a policy mix seeking to achieve deep climate mitigation goals (e.g., net zero emissions by 2045 or 2050). We organize the insights across four broad policy evaluation criteria:\n\n1. Effectiveness (GHG mitigation): Research indicates that the LCFS policies in California, Oregon, and British Columbia have each helped to reduce GHG emissions to date, and forward-looking modeling indicates that a strong LCFS can play an additive role in a policy mix seeking deep GHG mitigation. However, complex sustainability impacts such as indirect land-use change (ILUC) require further research, and potentially more careful policy design. Relatedly, further research is needed understand how LCFS design can better focused on \"advanced\" rather than \"conventional\" biofuels.\n2. Efficiency: While it seems unlikely that an LCFS could be as efficient as a (technology-neutral) carbon price, research suggests that a well-designed LCFS can be a complement to a policy mix that includes carbon pricing or cap-and-trade. To improve LCFS efficiency, key\n\n<a id='8591404c-a2c0-4c91-ba46-0a1b4e8cf2ba'></a>\n\n61",

However, little is known about equity impacts, or the influence of key stakeholders on policy development and implementation, notably fossil fuel companies, biofuel companies, and electric utilities.\n\n<a id='90fe3199-61c8-4f4a-a627-db7ef372ecd1'></a>\n\n4. **Transformative signal:** An LCFS seems to send a transformative market signal to the fuel suppliers operating in the regions covered by this type of policy. While it is difficult to prove causality, enactment of an LCFS is associated with increased development of new, more advanced low-carbon fuels. It seems likely that more stringent, credible, and longer-term LCFS can induce more substantial investment, innovation, and ultimately, technological change.\n\n<a id='39ad4f91-7191-4846-8709-5aeafa37b392'></a>\n\nFor now, while substantial uncertainty remains, we believe there is\nevidence that an LCFS can play a complementary role to policy mixes in\nmany regions. The policy receives high levels of citizen support (at least\nin North America), and can potentially induce additive technological\nchange by providing a technology push to fuel suppliers in particular.\nOngoing research will be needed to track the impacts of LCFS policies\naround the world, especially as these policies become more stringent,\nand to further clarify how an LCFS can be designed to maximize its\neffectiveness and efficiency.\n\n<a id='1a722d12-d8fd-4651-937d-fe45f000e4fc'></a>\n\n## Author contribution statement\n\nThe authors confirm contribution to the paper, where J.
