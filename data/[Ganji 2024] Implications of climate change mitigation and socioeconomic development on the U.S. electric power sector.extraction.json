Despite significant research on global and national future pathways, there is a need for further exploration into the application of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to understand sub-national impacts on the electric power sector. This study employs the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA) to analyze how climate change mitigation and socioeconomic development interact in the U.S. electric power sector at the state level. We developed four scenarios covering different levels of decarbonization efforts and socioeconomic development. Our research findings reveal a prevailing trend towards a less carbon-intensive U.S. electric sector, propelled by an expanding presence of natural gas and renewable energies in the energy mix. Such capital turnover leads to a significant reduction of overall CO2 emissions from the electric sector, albeit at a higher lifetime cost in particularly eastern states. The mitigation efforts also lead to overall decreased water withdrawal and increased water consumption in the electric sector, however, disparities in state-level responses are observed. While population growth predominantly shapes electricity generation, unique state-level electrification potential yields indirect population-electricity dynamics. The spatially heterogeneous response suggests complex trade-offs associated with reconciling climate mitigation objectives with local electricity demand and resource con-straints. In sum, this research equips policymakers and stakeholders with invaluable insights to formulate mitigation strategies that align with the objective of the U.S. electric sector, both at a national and international level, while also catering to the unique characteristics of each state.\n\n<a id='04e18c8a-34ab-4a62-b252-6a0516780f79'></a>\n\n## Introduction\nThe electric power sector is a significant contributor to climate change as it accounts for 38% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally [1] and 25% in the U.S. in 2021 [2]. Policies and strategies have been proposed and implemented at the international [3] and national levels [4] to reduce GHG emissions from the electric power sector. The Clean Air Act (CAA) serves as the primary basis for federal regulation of GHG emissions in the U.S., in which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) works with states to reduce GHG emissions [5]. Despite several setbacks in climate mitigation initiatives [6,7], the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement and set an ambitious goal of economy-wide net-zero emissions by 2050, including a 65% reduction by 2030 [8]. Also, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will bring substantial changes to the power sector, aligning with climate goals and reinforcing energy security. This legislation will reshape energy policies,\n\n<a id='55b36556-5411-442e-a1d8-2eef2d2985e0'></a>\n\npromoting adaptations for economic stability, inflation reduction, and\nsector resilience. These changes will lead to transformative measures,\nprioritizing sustainable energy practices while addressing both eco-\nnomic and environmental concerns [4].\n\n<a id='d9d1c2cd-3a32-4915-b91f-7d0466567370'></a>\n\nThe success of achieving national climate mitigation targets relies heavily on the implementation of effective sub-national climate actions [9]. States employ a variety of programs to reduce their GHG emissions, such as climate action plans, mandatory GHG reporting, voluntary GHG reporting, and reduction programs [10]. Significant progress has already been made at the state level, with the current state and local GHG actions projected to reduce economy-wide emissions by 25% below the 2005 level by 2030 [9]. As of 2022, 25 states and territories have set GHG reduction targets, with some committing to achieving 100% clean energy goals by 2050 or earlier [11] through renewable portfolio standards, energy efficiency standards, and carbon pricing mechanisms. While decarbonizing the energy systems entails higher costs for most\n\n<a id='284b62e1-5664-480c-a464-f3edaeb2fce8'></a>\n\n* Corresponding author. E-mail address: luliu@iastate.edu (L.

Therefore, developing sub-national strategies for the power sector in alignment with a national mitigation target is a complex task, particularly when socioeconomic factors are expected to shift and impact power demand.\n\n<a id='e939669a-89f3-4580-be30-6cb92ffcbedf'></a>\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has devel-oped Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared So-cioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to explore different combinations of greenhouse gas emissions and socioeconomic trends [13,14]. Combining these scenarios allows for the examination of potential barriers and opportunities for climate mitigation and adaptation across a wide range of plausible futures. Additionally, the integrated assessment modeling (IAM) approach is widely employed to evaluate the viability of mitiga-tion strategies. IAMs have been extensively utilized in a large body of research to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies across scales [15-19]. These models are particularly relevant for poli-cymakers as they provide insights into the trade-offs between different mitigation strategies and the potential costs and benefits associated with their implementation. DeAngelo et al. [20] analyzed 177 global IAM scenarios with different warming levels and found that achieving 1.5 °C resulted in lower energy use, earlier net zero, and less electrification because of the shorter transition time, while greater than 2 °C produced more residual emissions and bioenergy use with regional disparities. McJeon et al. [21] found that with a below 2 °C global temperature objective, global coal consumption decreases by mid-century, and nat-ural gas consumption increases when carbon capture and storage is available and decreases when it is not. Zapata et al. [22] analyzed the impact of climate change on the energy system focusing on four renewable sources and found that while there were small climate im-pacts on renewable primary energy use globally, these impacts led to a decrease in fossil fuel use due to increase in renewables use for most regions, especially in North America. Fragkos et al. [23] explored low-emission scenarios for eleven countries and concluded that emission reductions are achieved through the uptake of renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements, and electrification of energy services. More-over, Khan et al. [24] investigated the impacts of temperature changes on the electricity sector within a scenario aligned with SSP2 and RCP 8.5. They found that Cooling Degree Hours (CDH) increased while Heating Degree Hours (HDH) decreased from 2015 to 2100, with sig-nificant state-level variations. For example, annual mean CDH increased by 30% in Arizona to 170% in Wyoming, and mean HDH decreased by 13% in Florida to 45% in Arizona. Such variations highlight the het-erogeneous impacts of temperature changes on electric sector capacity and investment requirements across the U.S. Burleyson et al. [25] assessed building electricity consumption responses in the western U.S. using two models, BEND and GCAM-USA, under combinations of sce-narios for radiative forcing (RCP4.5 & 8.5) and population change (SSP3 & 5). Despite structural differences, both models demonstrated similar responses, emphasizing the more significant impact of population change and also identified an increase in total building electricity con-sumption under the RCP8.5 scenario in certain states, while others remained largely unaffected. Kebede et al. [26] explored climate change impacts by integrating a global scenario framework, RCP-SSP-SPA, assessing how global pathways manifest as sub-national impacts in three deltas across West Africa and South Asia. Their integrated multi-scale (combined top-down and bottom-up) hybrid scenario approach, combining expert-based and participatory (joint expert-stakeholder) methods, emphasizes the significance of such approaches in address-ing uncertainty in adaptation decision-making, underlining its trans-ferability to other sub-national socio-ecological settings with multi-scale challenges.\n\n<a id='bc638aa6-c91f-4841-a6b7-8ed77537f8c5'></a>\n\nWhile prior research primarily concentrated on evaluating the\nviability and consequences of diverse low-emission trajectories, like\nthose outlined in the RCPs, for meeting global and national climate\n\n<a id='53701847-538d-44cc-ab8a-095a61efd67a'></a>\n\nobjectives, it is equally imperative to investigate how the RCP-SSP\npathways on a global scale manifest as impacts on electricity sectors at\nthe sub-national level. While sub-national actions have been shown to be\neffective in reducing emissions and supporting U.S. national efforts [9,\n12], there are fewer subnational-level studies that analyze how\ntop-down policies or targets impact the electric power sector at the state\nlevel. Hence, our study seeks to enhance comprehension of the interre-\nlation between top-down climate change mitigation and socioeconomic\nprogress (e.g., population and GDP) in shaping the U.S. electric power\nsector at the state level. By analyzing the potential impact of different\nsocioeconomic pathways on state level electricity and environmental\nconsequences (e.g., water, CO2 emissions, etc.), we can gain insights into\naligning sub-national mitigation strategies in the electricity sector with\nnational and global mitigation goals.\n\n<a id='fbc8642d-6603-44de-ad84-d8b9d00bf9a0'></a>\n\nMethods\n\nWe used the global change analysis model, USA version (GCAM-USA), which is an integrated assessment model developed to explore the dynamics of the coupled human-earth system and its response to global changes [27,28]. GCAM consists of five interconnected systems (energy, water, agriculture and land use, economy, and climate), running in 5-year intervals until 2100 [28]. GCAM has been widely employed in numerous studies to evaluate the potential impacts of different policy assumptions and socioeconomic factors on future conditions at national and international scales, such as the 4th and 5th IPCC assessment reports [14,29-32]. GCAM employs external data files containing assumptions about key drivers such as population, GDP, policies, etc., to estimate their implications on crucial outputs like GHG emissions, energy production, and water consumption. GCAM simulates the substitution of high-carbon technologies with low-carbon alternatives based on factors like costs, emissions constraints, and carbon prices. It can also simulate various mitigation actions, including carbon capture, electric vehicles, and more (Table S1). The energy system framework of GCAM encompasses resource production, energy transformation, final energy carriers, and end-use sectors (Fig. S1). The GCAM-USA model provides higher spatial detail, including 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The electricity generation sector within GCAM-USA offers greater detail compared to GCAM, including sub-annual load profiles, US-specific power sector technology costs, state-specific retirements of coal and nuclear plants, and grid region trading. This enables GCAM-USA to investigate mitigation and adaptation of the energy system at the state level, such as exploring state-level power sector capacity expansion pathways [33], electric vehicle deployment for U.S. [34], and environmental co-benefits of low-carbon pathways with state-level resolution [35]. A detailed description of water and power sector modeling in GCAM-USA is available in the Supplementary Material.\n\n<a id='52a14c4c-1818-4a6d-b0c8-c8245308ba5d'></a>\n\nIn this study, we employed GCAM-USA v5.4 and explored four future\nscenarios for the U.S. that are in line with the global RCPs and SSPs\npathways (Table 1). We selected RCP2.6, RCP6.0, SSP3, and SSP5 and\ncreated four scenarios by combining the RCPs and SSPs. The RCP-SSP\nscenarios are relevant in the global context. Our 'RCP-SSP equivalent'\nscenarios suggest that the conditions of these RCP-SSP scenarios in the\nU.S. context correspond to those outlined in the global scenarios. RCP2.6\nrepresents a \"very stringent\" pathway necessitating immediate GHG\n\n<a id='8f829f89-b9f8-4de5-a2be-54f1866565be'></a>\n\nTable 1\nScenarios analyzed in this study.\n<table id=\"1-1\">\n<tr><td id=\"1-2\">Scenarios</td><td id=\"1-3\"></td><td id=\"1-4\" colspan=\"2\">Socioeconomic development</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"1-5\"></td><td id=\"1-6\"></td><td id=\"1-7\">Low population/ GDP</td><td id=\"1-8\">High population/ GDP</td></tr>\n<tr><td id=\"1-9\">Climate Change Mitigation</td><td id=\"1-a\">Reference Low emission</td><td id=\"1-b\">RCP6.0-SSP3 equivalent RCP2.6-SSP3 equivalent</td><td id=\"1-c\">RCP6.0-SSP5 equivalent RCP2.6-SSP5 equivalent</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<a id='8d03c5b8-6a1f-4797-bf27-1e17110ffaeb'></a>\n\n\n\n<a id='98d2a82d-184c-4c50-9d59-9c68e68962ae'></a>\n\nF.

In the U.S. context, this translates to a 58% of CO2 emission reduction in 2050 relative to 2015 and zero emission around 2070. Conversely, RCP6.0 depicts a stabilization scenario where GHG emissions peak around 2080, leading to a continuous warming trend and a 3–4 °C global temperature increase by 2100 [30]. In the U.S. context, this is described by continuous growth in CO2 emissions with a peak projected to occur around the year 2095. It is worth noting that RCP6.0 is the reference scenario in GCAM. Incorporating both scenarios enables us to assess a wider array of potential outcomes. SSP3 embodies a \"regional rivalry\" scenario characterized by high challenges in mitigation and adaptation, prioritizing national and regional security over global cooperation. Industrialized countries experience slow economic growth and low population growth while developing countries face high population growth. In the U.S. context, population growth is projected to be low, with a slight decrease in the second half of the century. Population stabilizes around 267.5 million in 2100 (Fig. S2). In contrast, SSP5 portrays a \"Fossil fuel Development\" scenario with high challenges in mitigation but low challenges in adaptation. It envisions rapid global economic growth and the exploitation of fossil fuel resources to achieve socioeconomic development goals [36,37]. In the U.S. context, under the SSP5 scenario, the population is projected to steadily increase to 674.2 million by 2100 (Fig. S2). While a warming climate (i.e., RCP6.0) contributes to an increase in climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods, wildfires, etc.), delving into their intricate details surpasses the capacity of an aggregated model like GCAM-USA.\n\n<a id='2b9c4b5f-2a1c-42b8-9658-3b219ef9a61f'></a>\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, electricity demand is projected to increase under High population/GDP scenarios, with greater increases when mitigation is present. Mitigation leads to more end-use electrification, particularly in the industry and transportation sectors (Fig. S3) because of the aggressive push towards economy-wide decarbonization. In the Low population/GDP scenarios, a slight decrease in the second half of the century is observed, following the trajectories of the population in these scenarios (Fig. S2). This shows that electricity demand is strongly influenced by population trajectory.\n\n<a id='660b57ed-f327-4381-affb-06609284054e'></a>\n\nThe share of renewables in the U.S. electric generation mix has been\nincreasing in recent years, growing from 9.4% to 21.5% between 2000\nand 2022 [38], and this trend is expected to continue due to ongoing\n\n<a id='897b6af5-d781-4376-9286-7aba7e28cca6'></a>\n\nadvancements in renewable energy technologies, decreasing costs of renewables, growing public and political support for clean energy, and the implementation of state and federal policies (i.e., New Source and Performance Standards, the Investment Tax Credit, and the Production Tax credit) in incentivizing renewable energy (including wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and hydro) deployment. Our results (Fig. 1) confirm a general growth in low-carbon energy sources' shares (including renewables and nuclear) with a more pronounced increase under low emission scenarios. In the reference scenarios with low and high population/GDP, we observe a 122 % and 573 % increase from 2020 to 2100, respectively. In the low emission scenarios with low and high population/GDP, the increase is even more substantial, reaching 313 % and an impressive 1120 %, respectively. The share of renewables and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS) also increases substantially in low emission scenarios. This highlights the necessity of CCS for achieving aggressive mitigation targets by 2100. Notably, without mitigation, the share of natural gas increases by 79 % and 330 % from 2020 to 2100 with low and high population/GDP, respectively. This shows that in the absence of mitigation efforts, this cleaner and cheaper source of fuel is expected to meet most of the growing demand for electricity. Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge that such a significant surge in the natural gas share could lead to concerns regarding the sustainability of natural gas resources and the potential for their depletion. This, in turn, could result in higher prices and consequential environmental impacts.\n\n<a id='050f003c-200d-49ce-a794-cd53c822c194'></a>\n\nContrary to the general increasing trend in electricity generation across all scenarios, the implications on water withdrawals and con- sumption for the electricity sector are more complex. Fig. 2a shows that electric sector water withdrawals generally decrease across scenarios, and a drastic decline occurs before 2050 for low emission scenarios: -70 to -67% decrease from 2020 to 2050 for reference scenarios and -93 to -90% for low emission scenarios, respectively. The retirement of coal power plants and more water-efficient generation technologies are the primary contributors to the decline (Fig. S4.a). Other factors, such as increased use of non-water dependent cooling technologies and a shift towards renewable energy sources, also decreased overall water with- drawals [39]. It is worth noting that a slight increase is observed after 2050 for low emission scenarios, mainly attributed to the increasing trend in electricity generation driven by end-use electrification and decarbonization efforts (e.g., CCS). However, the impacts at the state level are diverse and heterogenous (Fig. 2.b). For instance,\n\n<a id='4f557a46-2f98-4d07-a3c7-cef8329aa87f'></a>\n\n<::chart: The image displays a multi-panel stacked bar chart titled \"Fig. 1.

The declining trend of water\nwithdrawal in the electricity sector is also substantiated by historical\ndata from 1990 to 2015 [40]. Several states, including Florida, Illinois,\nMichigan, and New York, experienced a reduction in thermoelectric\npower water withdrawals over this period (Fig. S5). Texas, however,\npresented an exception with a modest increase of 1.14%. On a national\nscale, there was a noteworthy 31.85% decrease in total\nthermoelectric-power water withdrawals within the U.S. during this\ntimeframe. This trend underscores the positive impact of integrating\nlow-carbon technologies and fostering increased use of water-efficient\ntechnologies within the energy sector.\n\n<a id='6cd4f124-8143-4742-a94b-7ea1441c8503'></a>\n\nThe trend of electric sector water consumption varies significantly among the different scenarios (Fig. S6.a). In the reference scenarios, a decline of -35 % is observed in the first half, followed by an increase in the high population/GDP scenario. Gradual decline throughout the century is observed in the low population/GDP scenario. In contrast, under the low emission scenarios, water consumption declines for the\n\n<a id='b0662056-c11d-4de5-a0e6-9965b66bc889'></a>\n\nfirst 30 years, then increases moderately and substantially in the low population/GDP scenario and high population/GDP scenario, respec- tively. The retirement of coal power plants and the uptake of less water- dependent cooling technologies (Fig. S4.b) are the main drivers behind the reduction before the 2030s. The increase in the second half is largely driven by growing electricity generation for end-use electrification. The rate of electricity generation growth to meet the demand outpaces the rate of decline from capital turnover. Notably, among all the scenarios, under the low emission scenario, water consumption reaches its peak across all states, and Texas stands out for having the most substantial water usage (Fig. S6.b). This complex dynamic among water, energy, and mitigation highlights the need for a holistic view that considers the benefits and trade-offs for decarbonizing the energy system at the state level.\n\n<a id='e884b4f4-0bf7-4bb8-aef6-0350bf5acc89'></a>\n\nTo better understand the effect of population growth on electricity\ndemand for each state, an elasticity indicator was developed. A linear\nrelationship is found between the change of population and the change\nof electricity generation (Fig. S7). Therefore, an elasticity indicator is\ncalculated by calculating the difference between the per capita electric\ngeneration (EJ/million people) in the base year (2015) for each state\nand the slope of (EJ/million people) the linear regression line that plots\nthe difference in electric generation (y) against the difference in\n\n<a id='d7fcc383-c0ca-453b-8f08-bf9e2b3e4836'></a>\n\n4\n\n<a id='6f24349b-5d78-4996-bed5-01e0d74671fd'></a>\n\nb) State level total electric sector water withdrawals in 2080.\n\n<a id='243c20ff-2555-4044-91ba-9bd8d0496001'></a>\n\nF.

A low value close to zero (whether positive or negative) indicates that population growth is the primary driver behind increases in electricity generation. A larger positive value suggests that factors other than population are influencing the observed growth of electricity generation.\n\n<a id='e7cddb5b-5e3e-4d67-9603-ac57728d6031'></a>\n\nAs can be seen in Fig. 3, the results illustrate heterogeneous responses at the state level. The largest electricity user in most states is the building sector (Fig. S8), whose electricity demand is a direct reflection of population. Therefore, the elasticity indicators for most states are close to 0 and electricity generation grows with population growth. However, in the case of Wyoming, the elasticity indicator is significantly greater than 0.3. This is attributed to Wyoming's relatively small population base [41] and the industry sector being the most significant consumer of electricity within the state (Fig. S8). End-use electrification of the industry sector leads to the increase in electricity generation in Wyoming, a pattern not notably swayed by the state's population dynamics. Similarly, Nebraska's electricity generation is influenced by various factors beyond population growth. Nebraska exhibits high per capita electricity consumption, an energy-intensive industrial sector, and significant energy demands resulting from extreme weather conditions, including hot summers and harsh winters [42]. These combined factors create Nebraska's energy profile, highlighting that population is just one aspect of its multifaceted energy generation equation. For Montana, the surge in electricity generation is influenced by the end-use electrification of the transportation sector. The state has the highest number of vehicles per person [43], and electrification of the transportation sector will lead to greater demand for electricity. Additionally, both West Virginia and Utah are net suppliers of electricity to the regional grid and are among the top states in interstate transfers of electricity [44,45]. Likewise, North Dakota follows a similar pattern, with about two-thirds of its generated power being transmitted to other states and Canada through the regional electric grid [46]. As a result, the increase in electricity generation in West Virginia, Utah, and North Dakota is not solely influenced by their respective populations but is also significantly impacted by electricity transfers to neighboring regions. These observations underscore the notion that while population growth contributes to the escalating electricity demand across the U.S., the pivotal driving factor tends to differ from one state to another.\n\n<a id='713e16e8-7e9a-4f0e-8fa6-90c198f58cae'></a>\n\nWe also examined the environmental consequences of mitigation and socioeconomic development. Fig. 4 illustrates the projected changes in CO2 intensity (million metric tons/EJ) from electricity generation relative to 2015 for each state. CO2 intensity refers to the ratio of CO2 emissions from the electricity sector to the amount of electricity generated. As can be observed, the CO2 intensity of electricity\n\n<a id='cd7a6b9a-9d13-4c5c-86be-31ffae0ee438'></a>\n\ngeneration is expected to decrease over time across all scenarios. However, the rate and pattern of such decrease are heterogeneous across all states. Renewable energies are prioritized in states in the Mountain (i. e., Wyoming), Midwest (i.e., Missouri), and South (i.e., Texas) regions and limited in the Atlantic (i.e., New York) and Pacific regions (i.e., Washington). States characterized by a significant proportion of coal- fired electricity generation, such as Wyoming and West Virginia, are projected to experience significant reductions in the CO2 intensity of their electricity generation. This trend is especially prominent when considering scenarios characterized by low emissions. Anticipated de- clines of approximately -233 and -240 million metric tons/EJ on average by 2080, in comparison to the year 2015, are attributed to the combined impact of retiring coal-fired power generation and the adop- tion of renewable energy sources. Conversely, states like South Dakota, which already embrace a substantial share of renewable energy (with over 80% of its electricity generated from renewables in 2021 [47]), face a more constrained potential for further enhancing their CO2 in- tensity performance. Projections suggest a comparatively narrower scope for improvement, with an average anticipated reduction of approximately -50 million metric tons/EJ by 2080 relative to the reference year of 2015, as outlined in scenarios with low emissions. Texas, on the other hand, exhibits an intriguing dynamic, while it ex- periences a significant reduction in CO2 intensity, with an average reduction of roughly -102 million metric tons/EJ by 2080, it also faces a notable increase in water withdrawal. This dual trend underscores the intricate challenges and trade-offs involved in transitioning to a low-carbon energy framework. It exemplifies how states must carefully balance environmental considerations, such as CO2 emissions, with other critical resources like water. These contrasting outcomes empha- size the distinct capacities of each state to navigate the complex tran- sition toward a low-carbon energy framework.\n\n<a id='ae0b9830-9817-47d1-a816-faef85280a73'></a>\n\nWe also investigated the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) under\nlow emission scenarios in comparison to that of under the \"Stated Pol-\nicies\" and the \"Announced Pledges\" [48] (Fig. 5a). LCOE is a measure of\nthe average net present cost of electricity generation for a generator over\nits lifetime [49]. It includes initial capital investment, operational and\nmaintenance costs, and expected energy output. It has been widely used\nto compare various forms of electricity production for investment de-\ncisions. The \"Stated Policies\" scenario assumes current policies and\nimplementing measures will continue without additional efforts,\nconsidering adopted policies, proposals, and yet-to-be-developed mea-\nsures. In contrast, the \"Announced Pledges\" scenario assumes the suc-\ncessful implementation of government commitments and targets under\nthe Paris Agreement, including Nationally Determined Contributions\n(NDCs) and net zero goals [48]. The LCOE values for reference scenarios\n\n<a id='a586d34f-cdfc-49cb-b68f-98edd3e8ba68'></a>\n\n<::The image displays two choropleth maps of the United States, side-by-side, illustrating an \"Elasticity Indicator\" under \"Low Emission\" and \"Reference\" scenarios, respectively.

This means that although\nelectricity demand may change due to population changes, the unit cost\nfor electricity remains relatively stable when there are no mitigations.\nThe LCOEs for low emission scenarios in 2050 are higher than those of\n2020 (43 % and 40 % increase from 2020 for High and Low pop-\nulation/GDP scenarios, respectively). Moreover, the LCOEs are also\nhigher for eastern states, with Washington D.C. notably standing out\nwith the highest value (Fig. 5b). This highlights the trade-off associated\nwith mitigation endeavors: while they can effectively curtail CO2\nemissions, they concurrently entail higher lifetime costs for electricity\ngeneration.\n\n<a id='0b7dd175-f6c9-47f1-9f76-a3ab7cd80589'></a>\n\nThrough a comparison of CO2 emissions, our analysis reveals that our\nlow emission scenarios exhibit a more assertive stance than the \"Stated\nPolicies\" scenario yet remain less ambitious than the \"Announced\nPledges\" scenario and lag further behind the U.S. net-zero emissions by\n2050 [50]. This underscores that the trajectory toward emissions in line\nwith RCP2.6 lies beyond the attainable scope of the present \"Stated\nPolicies\" within the United States. Even if we consider a more gradual\n\n<a id='dbdeecae-fc54-4d5e-9287-30723446c788'></a>\n\npopulation growth scenario (Low emission-Low population/GDP), the attainment of net-zero emissions by 2050 remains unfeasible. As such, there's a pressing necessity for more vigorous measures akin to those outlined in the \"Announced Pledges\" to be promptly enacted.\n\n<a id='e5ee6b8d-7e53-46ab-8a87-b0b11e5d091c'></a>\n\nAchieving the net-zero target by 2050 in the U.S. would have profound implications across various sectors, impacting the environment, economy, public health, and international relations. Although our study does not delve into a comprehensive analysis of these implications, we posit that attaining net-zero emissions would demand a significantly higher uptake of renewable energy sources, higher levels of end-use electrification, and a consequent surge in electricity demand [51] compared to our low-emission scenarios. The path taken to achieve net-zero emissions introduces variability in its impact on water usage and mitigation costs [52]. Recognizing this, our study contributes valuable insights to comprehend the broader implications of the U.S. net-zero goal.\n\n<a id='df040c2e-ffac-4ed9-82da-b0f44d3eee99'></a>\n\nConclusion\n\nPrevious research has primarily centered on global and national climate objectives, with less emphasis on how RCP-SSP pathways influence the sub-national electricity sector. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing how climate change mitigation and socioeconomic development interact in the U.S. electric power sector at the state level. The analysis delves into the effects on electricity generation, electricity water withdrawal and consumption, CO2 intensity, and levelized cost of electricity (LOCE) at the state level. The underlying mechanisms that drive the heterogeneous responses at the state level are also examined. Several key conclusions can be drawn from this study.\n\n<a id='ac55eea6-c798-44d6-9d80-6766b1ff8485'></a>\n\nFirst, expanding end-use electrification in the building and industry sectors not only facilitates the attainment of mitigation objectives but also catalyzes a surge in electricity generation. This surge is enabled by a rapid growth of natural gas utilization in conjunction with renewable energy sources. Population growth is the primary catalyst behind the surges in most states. In states where the industry sector is the dominant end-user, the interplay between population and electricity dynamics is comparatively subdued. This underscores the importance of understanding end-use electricity for gauging future electricity demand, considering diverse patterns and electrification potential at the state level.\n\n<a id='f6b08814-2b8e-4400-a7d0-1a959cb6dd69'></a>\n\nSecond, sustainable electricity generation requires balancing multiple considerations, including emissions, environmental conservation, and economic viability [53]. Our low emission scenarios notably reduce water withdrawals, aligning with resource conservation. This shift is propelled by technological advancements, more efficient water cooling, and the embrace of renewable energy sources. Despite the decrease in water withdrawals, water consumption increases. Diverse impacts of mitigation on electricity water use are evident, resulting in increased water withdrawals for certain states (i.e., Texas) while causing reductions for others (i.e., Florida). In our low emission scenarios, renewable energies are prioritized in states in the Mountain (i.e., Wyoming), Midwest (i.e., Missouri), and South (i.e., Texas) regions and limited in the Atlantic (i.e., New York) and Pacific regions (i.e., Washington). Substantial CO2 reduction is achieved, though accompanied by an increased Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), particularly in the eastern states. However, the combined efforts still fall short of achieving the collective commitments under the Paris Agreement. This underscores the importance of managing the balance between water resources, mitigation efforts, and economic feasibility at the state level.\n\n<a id='934aa101-99eb-458e-a95e-8ebda7af99f6'></a>\n\nOverall, this research underscores the complexity of reconciling climate mitigation objectives with local electricity demand and resource constraints. It highlights the need for nuanced, state-specific strategies that balance emissions reduction, electricity demand, and water usage. As we steer through the transition to a more sustainable energy landscape, the collaboration between global targets and regional realities emerges as a compelling necessity, compelling policymakers and\n\n<a id='eecb2470-fca5-4246-bc1f-263c04888e68'></a>\n\n6\n\n<a id='50e04596-2daf-4c7c-ae38-11e386224ba3'></a>\n\nF.

Despite significant research on global and national future pathways, there is a need for further exploration into the application of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to understand sub-national impacts on the electric power sector. This study employs the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA) to analyze how climate change mitigation and socioeconomic development interact in the U.S. electric power sector at the state level. We developed four scenarios covering different levels of decarbonization efforts and socioeconomic development. Our research findings reveal a prevailing trend towards a less carbon-intensive U.S. electric sector, propelled by an expanding presence of natural gas and renewable energies in the energy mix. Such capital turnover leads to a significant reduction of overall CO2 emissions from the electric sector, albeit at a higher lifetime cost in particularly eastern states. The mitigation efforts also lead to overall decreased water withdrawal and increased water consumption in the electric sector, however, disparities in state-level responses are observed. While population growth predominantly shapes electricity generation, unique state-level electrification potential yields indirect population-electricity dynamics. The spatially heterogeneous response suggests complex trade-offs associated with reconciling climate mitigation objectives with local electricity demand and resource con-straints. In sum, this research equips policymakers and stakeholders with invaluable insights to formulate mitigation strategies that align with the objective of the U.S. electric sector, both at a national and international level, while also catering to the unique characteristics of each state.",

Policies and strategies have been proposed and implemented at the international [3] and national levels [4] to reduce GHG emissions from the electric power sector. The Clean Air Act (CAA) serves as the primary basis for federal regulation of GHG emissions in the U.S., in which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) works with states to reduce GHG emissions [5]. Despite several setbacks in climate mitigation initiatives [6,7], the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement and set an ambitious goal of economy-wide net-zero emissions by 2050, including a 65% reduction by 2030 [8]. Also, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will bring substantial changes to the power sector, aligning with climate goals and reinforcing energy security. This legislation will reshape energy policies,",

States employ a variety of programs to reduce their GHG emissions, such as climate action plans, mandatory GHG reporting, voluntary GHG reporting, and reduction programs [10]. Significant progress has already been made at the state level, with the current state and local GHG actions projected to reduce economy-wide emissions by 25% below the 2005 level by 2030 [9]. As of 2022, 25 states and territories have set GHG reduction targets, with some committing to achieving 100% clean energy goals by 2050 or earlier [11] through renewable portfolio standards, energy efficiency standards, and carbon pricing mechanisms. While decarbonizing the energy systems entails higher costs for most",

Combining these scenarios allows for the examination of potential barriers and opportunities for climate mitigation and adaptation across a wide range of plausible futures. Additionally, the integrated assessment modeling (IAM) approach is widely employed to evaluate the viability of mitiga-tion strategies. IAMs have been extensively utilized in a large body of research to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies across scales [15-19]. These models are particularly relevant for poli-cymakers as they provide insights into the trade-offs between different mitigation strategies and the potential costs and benefits associated with their implementation. DeAngelo et al. [20] analyzed 177 global IAM scenarios with different warming levels and found that achieving 1.5 °C resulted in lower energy use, earlier net zero, and less electrification because of the shorter transition time, while greater than 2 °C produced more residual emissions and bioenergy use with regional disparities. McJeon et al. [21] found that with a below 2 °C global temperature objective, global coal consumption decreases by mid-century, and nat-ural gas consumption increases when carbon capture and storage is available and decreases when it is not. Zapata et al. [22] analyzed the impact of climate change on the energy system focusing on four renewable sources and found that while there were small climate im-pacts on renewable primary energy use globally, these impacts led to a decrease in fossil fuel use due to increase in renewables use for most regions, especially in North America. Fragkos et al. [23] explored low-emission scenarios for eleven countries and concluded that emission reductions are achieved through the uptake of renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements, and electrification of energy services. More-over, Khan et al. [24] investigated the impacts of temperature changes on the electricity sector within a scenario aligned with SSP2 and RCP 8.5. They found that Cooling Degree Hours (CDH) increased while Heating Degree Hours (HDH) decreased from 2015 to 2100, with sig-nificant state-level variations. For example, annual mean CDH increased by 30% in Arizona to 170% in Wyoming, and mean HDH decreased by 13% in Florida to 45% in Arizona. Such variations highlight the het-erogeneous impacts of temperature changes on electric sector capacity and investment requirements across the U.S. Burleyson et al. [25] assessed building electricity consumption responses in the western U.S. using two models, BEND and GCAM-USA, under combinations of sce-narios for radiative forcing (RCP4.5 & 8.5) and population change (SSP3 & 5). Despite structural differences, both models demonstrated similar responses, emphasizing the more significant impact of population change and also identified an increase in total building electricity con-sumption under the RCP8.5 scenario in certain states, while others remained largely unaffected. Kebede et al. [26] explored climate change impacts by integrating a global scenario framework, RCP-SSP-SPA, assessing how global pathways manifest as sub-national impacts in three deltas across West Africa and South Asia. Their integrated multi-scale (combined top-down and bottom-up) hybrid scenario approach, combining expert-based and participatory (joint expert-stakeholder) methods, emphasizes the significance of such approaches in address-ing uncertainty in adaptation decision-making, underlining its trans-ferability to other sub-national socio-ecological settings with multi-scale challenges.",

GCAM consists of five interconnected systems (energy, water, agriculture and land use, economy, and climate), running in 5-year intervals until 2100 [28]. GCAM has been widely employed in numerous studies to evaluate the potential impacts of different policy assumptions and socioeconomic factors on future conditions at national and international scales, such as the 4th and 5th IPCC assessment reports [14,29-32]. GCAM employs external data files containing assumptions about key drivers such as population, GDP, policies, etc., to estimate their implications on crucial outputs like GHG emissions, energy production, and water consumption. GCAM simulates the substitution of high-carbon technologies with low-carbon alternatives based on factors like costs, emissions constraints, and carbon prices. It can also simulate various mitigation actions, including carbon capture, electric vehicles, and more (Table S1). The energy system framework of GCAM encompasses resource production, energy transformation, final energy carriers, and end-use sectors (Fig. S1). The GCAM-USA model provides higher spatial detail, including 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The electricity generation sector within GCAM-USA offers greater detail compared to GCAM, including sub-annual load profiles, US-specific power sector technology costs, state-specific retirements of coal and nuclear plants, and grid region trading. This enables GCAM-USA to investigate mitigation and adaptation of the energy system at the state level, such as exploring state-level power sector capacity expansion pathways [33], electric vehicle deployment for U.S. [34], and environmental co-benefits of low-carbon pathways with state-level resolution [35]. A detailed description of water and power sector modeling in GCAM-USA is available in the Supplementary Material.",

In the U.S. context, this translates to a 58% of CO2 emission reduction in 2050 relative to 2015 and zero emission around 2070. Conversely, RCP6.0 depicts a stabilization scenario where GHG emissions peak around 2080, leading to a continuous warming trend and a 3–4 °C global temperature increase by 2100 [30]. In the U.S. context, this is described by continuous growth in CO2 emissions with a peak projected to occur around the year 2095. It is worth noting that RCP6.0 is the reference scenario in GCAM. Incorporating both scenarios enables us to assess a wider array of potential outcomes. SSP3 embodies a \"regional rivalry\" scenario characterized by high challenges in mitigation and adaptation, prioritizing national and regional security over global cooperation. Industrialized countries experience slow economic growth and low population growth while developing countries face high population growth. In the U.S. context, population growth is projected to be low, with a slight decrease in the second half of the century. Population stabilizes around 267.5 million in 2100 (Fig. S2). In contrast, SSP5 portrays a \"Fossil fuel Development\" scenario with high challenges in mitigation but low challenges in adaptation. It envisions rapid global economic growth and the exploitation of fossil fuel resources to achieve socioeconomic development goals [36,37]. In the U.S. context, under the SSP5 scenario, the population is projected to steadily increase to 674.2 million by 2100 (Fig. S2). While a warming climate (i.e., RCP6.0) contributes to an increase in climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods, wildfires, etc.), delving into their intricate details surpasses the capacity of an aggregated model like GCAM-USA.",

Our results (Fig. 1) confirm a general growth in low-carbon energy sources' shares (including renewables and nuclear) with a more pronounced increase under low emission scenarios. In the reference scenarios with low and high population/GDP, we observe a 122 % and 573 % increase from 2020 to 2100, respectively. In the low emission scenarios with low and high population/GDP, the increase is even more substantial, reaching 313 % and an impressive 1120 %, respectively. The share of renewables and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS) also increases substantially in low emission scenarios. This highlights the necessity of CCS for achieving aggressive mitigation targets by 2100. Notably, without mitigation, the share of natural gas increases by 79 % and 330 % from 2020 to 2100 with low and high population/GDP, respectively. This shows that in the absence of mitigation efforts, this cleaner and cheaper source of fuel is expected to meet most of the growing demand for electricity. Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge that such a significant surge in the natural gas share could lead to concerns regarding the sustainability of natural gas resources and the potential for their depletion. This, in turn, could result in higher prices and consequential environmental impacts.",

Fig. 2a shows that electric sector water withdrawals generally decrease across scenarios, and a drastic decline occurs before 2050 for low emission scenarios: -70 to -67% decrease from 2020 to 2050 for reference scenarios and -93 to -90% for low emission scenarios, respectively. The retirement of coal power plants and more water-efficient generation technologies are the primary contributors to the decline (Fig. S4.a). Other factors, such as increased use of non-water dependent cooling technologies and a shift towards renewable energy sources, also decreased overall water with- drawals [39]. It is worth noting that a slight increase is observed after 2050 for low emission scenarios, mainly attributed to the increasing trend in electricity generation driven by end-use electrification and decarbonization efforts (e.g., CCS). However, the impacts at the state level are diverse and heterogenous (Fig. 2.b). For instance,",

The largest electricity user in most states is the building sector (Fig. S8), whose electricity demand is a direct reflection of population. Therefore, the elasticity indicators for most states are close to 0 and electricity generation grows with population growth. However, in the case of Wyoming, the elasticity indicator is significantly greater than 0.3. This is attributed to Wyoming's relatively small population base [41] and the industry sector being the most significant consumer of electricity within the state (Fig. S8). End-use electrification of the industry sector leads to the increase in electricity generation in Wyoming, a pattern not notably swayed by the state's population dynamics. Similarly, Nebraska's electricity generation is influenced by various factors beyond population growth. Nebraska exhibits high per capita electricity consumption, an energy-intensive industrial sector, and significant energy demands resulting from extreme weather conditions, including hot summers and harsh winters [42]. These combined factors create Nebraska's energy profile, highlighting that population is just one aspect of its multifaceted energy generation equation. For Montana, the surge in electricity generation is influenced by the end-use electrification of the transportation sector. The state has the highest number of vehicles per person [43], and electrification of the transportation sector will lead to greater demand for electricity. Additionally, both West Virginia and Utah are net suppliers of electricity to the regional grid and are among the top states in interstate transfers of electricity [44,45]. Likewise, North Dakota follows a similar pattern, with about two-thirds of its generated power being transmitted to other states and Canada through the regional electric grid [46]. As a result, the increase in electricity generation in West Virginia, Utah, and North Dakota is not solely influenced by their respective populations but is also significantly impacted by electricity transfers to neighboring regions. These observations underscore the notion that while population growth contributes to the escalating electricity demand across the U.S., the pivotal driving factor tends to differ from one state to another.",

However, the rate and pattern of such decrease are heterogeneous across all states. Renewable energies are prioritized in states in the Mountain (i. e., Wyoming), Midwest (i.e., Missouri), and South (i.e., Texas) regions and limited in the Atlantic (i.e., New York) and Pacific regions (i.e., Washington). States characterized by a significant proportion of coal- fired electricity generation, such as Wyoming and West Virginia, are projected to experience significant reductions in the CO2 intensity of their electricity generation. This trend is especially prominent when considering scenarios characterized by low emissions. Anticipated de- clines of approximately -233 and -240 million metric tons/EJ on average by 2080, in comparison to the year 2015, are attributed to the combined impact of retiring coal-fired power generation and the adop- tion of renewable energy sources. Conversely, states like South Dakota, which already embrace a substantial share of renewable energy (with over 80% of its electricity generated from renewables in 2021 [47]), face a more constrained potential for further enhancing their CO2 in- tensity performance. Projections suggest a comparatively narrower scope for improvement, with an average anticipated reduction of approximately -50 million metric tons/EJ by 2080 relative to the reference year of 2015, as outlined in scenarios with low emissions. Texas, on the other hand, exhibits an intriguing dynamic, while it ex- periences a significant reduction in CO2 intensity, with an average reduction of roughly -102 million metric tons/EJ by 2080, it also faces a notable increase in water withdrawal. This dual trend underscores the intricate challenges and trade-offs involved in transitioning to a low-carbon energy framework. It exemplifies how states must carefully balance environmental considerations, such as CO2 emissions, with other critical resources like water. These contrasting outcomes empha- size the distinct capacities of each state to navigate the complex tran- sition toward a low-carbon energy framework.",

Our study addresses this gap by analyzing how climate change mitigation and socioeconomic development interact in the U.S. electric power sector at the state level. The analysis delves into the effects on electricity generation, electricity water withdrawal and consumption, CO2 intensity, and levelized cost of electricity (LOCE) at the state level. The underlying mechanisms that drive the heterogeneous responses at the state level are also examined. Several key conclusions can be drawn from this study.",

This surge is enabled by a rapid growth of natural gas utilization in conjunction with renewable energy sources. Population growth is the primary catalyst behind the surges in most states. In states where the industry sector is the dominant end-user, the interplay between population and electricity dynamics is comparatively subdued. This underscores the importance of understanding end-use electricity for gauging future electricity demand, considering diverse patterns and electrification potential at the state level.",

Our low emission scenarios notably reduce water withdrawals, aligning with resource conservation. This shift is propelled by technological advancements, more efficient water cooling, and the embrace of renewable energy sources. Despite the decrease in water withdrawals, water consumption increases. Diverse impacts of mitigation on electricity water use are evident, resulting in increased water withdrawals for certain states (i.e., Texas) while causing reductions for others (i.e., Florida). In our low emission scenarios, renewable energies are prioritized in states in the Mountain (i.e., Wyoming), Midwest (i.e., Missouri), and South (i.e., Texas) regions and limited in the Atlantic (i.e., New York) and Pacific regions (i.e., Washington). Substantial CO2 reduction is achieved, though accompanied by an increased Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), particularly in the eastern states. However, the combined efforts still fall short of achieving the collective commitments under the Paris Agreement. This underscores the importance of managing the balance between water resources, mitigation efforts, and economic feasibility at the state level.",

Despite significant research on global and national future pathways, there is a need for further exploration into the application of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to understand sub-national impacts on the electric power sector. This study employs the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA) to analyze how climate change mitigation and socioeconomic development interact in the U.S. electric power sector at the state level. We developed four scenarios covering different levels of decarbonization efforts and socioeconomic development. Our research findings reveal a prevailing trend towards a less carbon-intensive U.S. electric sector, propelled by an expanding presence of natural gas and renewable energies in the energy mix. Such capital turnover leads to a significant reduction of overall CO2 emissions from the electric sector, albeit at a higher lifetime cost in particularly eastern states. The mitigation efforts also lead to overall decreased water withdrawal and increased water consumption in the electric sector, however, disparities in state-level responses are observed. While population growth predominantly shapes electricity generation, unique state-level electrification potential yields indirect population-electricity dynamics. The spatially heterogeneous response suggests complex trade-offs associated with reconciling climate mitigation objectives with local electricity demand and resource con-straints. In sum, this research equips policymakers and stakeholders with invaluable insights to formulate mitigation strategies that align with the objective of the U.S. electric sector, both at a national and international level, while also catering to the unique characteristics of each state.\n\n<a id='04e18c8a-34ab-4a62-b252-6a0516780f79'></a>\n\n## Introduction\nThe electric power sector is a significant contributor to climate change as it accounts for 38% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally [1] and 25% in the U.S. in 2021 [2]. Policies and strategies have been proposed and implemented at the international [3] and national levels [4] to reduce GHG emissions from the electric power sector. The Clean Air Act (CAA) serves as the primary basis for federal regulation of GHG emissions in the U.S., in which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) works with states to reduce GHG emissions [5]. Despite several setbacks in climate mitigation initiatives [6,7], the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement and set an ambitious goal of economy-wide net-zero emissions by 2050, including a 65% reduction by 2030 [8]. Also, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will bring substantial changes to the power sector, aligning with climate goals and reinforcing energy security. This legislation will reshape energy policies,\n\n<a id='55b36556-5411-442e-a1d8-2eef2d2985e0'></a>\n\npromoting adaptations for economic stability, inflation reduction, and\nsector resilience. These changes will lead to transformative measures,\nprioritizing sustainable energy practices while addressing both eco-\nnomic and environmental concerns [4].\n\n<a id='d9d1c2cd-3a32-4915-b91f-7d0466567370'></a>\n\nThe success of achieving national climate mitigation targets relies heavily on the implementation of effective sub-national climate actions [9]. States employ a variety of programs to reduce their GHG emissions, such as climate action plans, mandatory GHG reporting, voluntary GHG reporting, and reduction programs [10]. Significant progress has already been made at the state level, with the current state and local GHG actions projected to reduce economy-wide emissions by 25% below the 2005 level by 2030 [9]. As of 2022, 25 states and territories have set GHG reduction targets, with some committing to achieving 100% clean energy goals by 2050 or earlier [11] through renewable portfolio standards, energy efficiency standards, and carbon pricing mechanisms. While decarbonizing the energy systems entails higher costs for most\n\n<a id='284b62e1-5664-480c-a464-f3edaeb2fce8'></a>\n\n* Corresponding author. E-mail address: luliu@iastate.edu (L.

Therefore, developing sub-national strategies for the power sector in alignment with a national mitigation target is a complex task, particularly when socioeconomic factors are expected to shift and impact power demand.\n\n<a id='e939669a-89f3-4580-be30-6cb92ffcbedf'></a>\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has devel-oped Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared So-cioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to explore different combinations of greenhouse gas emissions and socioeconomic trends [13,14]. Combining these scenarios allows for the examination of potential barriers and opportunities for climate mitigation and adaptation across a wide range of plausible futures. Additionally, the integrated assessment modeling (IAM) approach is widely employed to evaluate the viability of mitiga-tion strategies. IAMs have been extensively utilized in a large body of research to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies across scales [15-19]. These models are particularly relevant for poli-cymakers as they provide insights into the trade-offs between different mitigation strategies and the potential costs and benefits associated with their implementation. DeAngelo et al. [20] analyzed 177 global IAM scenarios with different warming levels and found that achieving 1.5 °C resulted in lower energy use, earlier net zero, and less electrification because of the shorter transition time, while greater than 2 °C produced more residual emissions and bioenergy use with regional disparities. McJeon et al. [21] found that with a below 2 °C global temperature objective, global coal consumption decreases by mid-century, and nat-ural gas consumption increases when carbon capture and storage is available and decreases when it is not. Zapata et al. [22] analyzed the impact of climate change on the energy system focusing on four renewable sources and found that while there were small climate im-pacts on renewable primary energy use globally, these impacts led to a decrease in fossil fuel use due to increase in renewables use for most regions, especially in North America. Fragkos et al. [23] explored low-emission scenarios for eleven countries and concluded that emission reductions are achieved through the uptake of renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements, and electrification of energy services. More-over, Khan et al. [24] investigated the impacts of temperature changes on the electricity sector within a scenario aligned with SSP2 and RCP 8.5. They found that Cooling Degree Hours (CDH) increased while Heating Degree Hours (HDH) decreased from 2015 to 2100, with sig-nificant state-level variations. For example, annual mean CDH increased by 30% in Arizona to 170% in Wyoming, and mean HDH decreased by 13% in Florida to 45% in Arizona. Such variations highlight the het-erogeneous impacts of temperature changes on electric sector capacity and investment requirements across the U.S. Burleyson et al. [25] assessed building electricity consumption responses in the western U.S. using two models, BEND and GCAM-USA, under combinations of sce-narios for radiative forcing (RCP4.5 & 8.5) and population change (SSP3 & 5). Despite structural differences, both models demonstrated similar responses, emphasizing the more significant impact of population change and also identified an increase in total building electricity con-sumption under the RCP8.5 scenario in certain states, while others remained largely unaffected. Kebede et al. [26] explored climate change impacts by integrating a global scenario framework, RCP-SSP-SPA, assessing how global pathways manifest as sub-national impacts in three deltas across West Africa and South Asia. Their integrated multi-scale (combined top-down and bottom-up) hybrid scenario approach, combining expert-based and participatory (joint expert-stakeholder) methods, emphasizes the significance of such approaches in address-ing uncertainty in adaptation decision-making, underlining its trans-ferability to other sub-national socio-ecological settings with multi-scale challenges.\n\n<a id='bc638aa6-c91f-4841-a6b7-8ed77537f8c5'></a>\n\nWhile prior research primarily concentrated on evaluating the\nviability and consequences of diverse low-emission trajectories, like\nthose outlined in the RCPs, for meeting global and national climate\n\n<a id='53701847-538d-44cc-ab8a-095a61efd67a'></a>\n\nobjectives, it is equally imperative to investigate how the RCP-SSP\npathways on a global scale manifest as impacts on electricity sectors at\nthe sub-national level. While sub-national actions have been shown to be\neffective in reducing emissions and supporting U.S. national efforts [9,\n12], there are fewer subnational-level studies that analyze how\ntop-down policies or targets impact the electric power sector at the state\nlevel. Hence, our study seeks to enhance comprehension of the interre-\nlation between top-down climate change mitigation and socioeconomic\nprogress (e.g., population and GDP) in shaping the U.S. electric power\nsector at the state level. By analyzing the potential impact of different\nsocioeconomic pathways on state level electricity and environmental\nconsequences (e.g., water, CO2 emissions, etc.), we can gain insights into\naligning sub-national mitigation strategies in the electricity sector with\nnational and global mitigation goals.\n\n<a id='fbc8642d-6603-44de-ad84-d8b9d00bf9a0'></a>\n\nMethods\n\nWe used the global change analysis model, USA version (GCAM-USA), which is an integrated assessment model developed to explore the dynamics of the coupled human-earth system and its response to global changes [27,28]. GCAM consists of five interconnected systems (energy, water, agriculture and land use, economy, and climate), running in 5-year intervals until 2100 [28]. GCAM has been widely employed in numerous studies to evaluate the potential impacts of different policy assumptions and socioeconomic factors on future conditions at national and international scales, such as the 4th and 5th IPCC assessment reports [14,29-32]. GCAM employs external data files containing assumptions about key drivers such as population, GDP, policies, etc., to estimate their implications on crucial outputs like GHG emissions, energy production, and water consumption. GCAM simulates the substitution of high-carbon technologies with low-carbon alternatives based on factors like costs, emissions constraints, and carbon prices. It can also simulate various mitigation actions, including carbon capture, electric vehicles, and more (Table S1). The energy system framework of GCAM encompasses resource production, energy transformation, final energy carriers, and end-use sectors (Fig. S1). The GCAM-USA model provides higher spatial detail, including 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The electricity generation sector within GCAM-USA offers greater detail compared to GCAM, including sub-annual load profiles, US-specific power sector technology costs, state-specific retirements of coal and nuclear plants, and grid region trading. This enables GCAM-USA to investigate mitigation and adaptation of the energy system at the state level, such as exploring state-level power sector capacity expansion pathways [33], electric vehicle deployment for U.S. [34], and environmental co-benefits of low-carbon pathways with state-level resolution [35]. A detailed description of water and power sector modeling in GCAM-USA is available in the Supplementary Material.\n\n<a id='52a14c4c-1818-4a6d-b0c8-c8245308ba5d'></a>\n\nIn this study, we employed GCAM-USA v5.4 and explored four future\nscenarios for the U.S. that are in line with the global RCPs and SSPs\npathways (Table 1). We selected RCP2.6, RCP6.0, SSP3, and SSP5 and\ncreated four scenarios by combining the RCPs and SSPs. The RCP-SSP\nscenarios are relevant in the global context. Our 'RCP-SSP equivalent'\nscenarios suggest that the conditions of these RCP-SSP scenarios in the\nU.S. context correspond to those outlined in the global scenarios.

In the U.S. context, this translates to a 58% of CO2 emission reduction in 2050 relative to 2015 and zero emission around 2070. Conversely, RCP6.0 depicts a stabilization scenario where GHG emissions peak around 2080, leading to a continuous warming trend and a 3–4 °C global temperature increase by 2100 [30]. In the U.S. context, this is described by continuous growth in CO2 emissions with a peak projected to occur around the year 2095. It is worth noting that RCP6.0 is the reference scenario in GCAM. Incorporating both scenarios enables us to assess a wider array of potential outcomes. SSP3 embodies a \"regional rivalry\" scenario characterized by high challenges in mitigation and adaptation, prioritizing national and regional security over global cooperation. Industrialized countries experience slow economic growth and low population growth while developing countries face high population growth. In the U.S. context, population growth is projected to be low, with a slight decrease in the second half of the century. Population stabilizes around 267.5 million in 2100 (Fig. S2). In contrast, SSP5 portrays a \"Fossil fuel Development\" scenario with high challenges in mitigation but low challenges in adaptation. It envisions rapid global economic growth and the exploitation of fossil fuel resources to achieve socioeconomic development goals [36,37]. In the U.S. context, under the SSP5 scenario, the population is projected to steadily increase to 674.2 million by 2100 (Fig. S2). While a warming climate (i.e., RCP6.0) contributes to an increase in climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods, wildfires, etc.), delving into their intricate details surpasses the capacity of an aggregated model like GCAM-USA.\n\n<a id='2b9c4b5f-2a1c-42b8-9658-3b219ef9a61f'></a>\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, electricity demand is projected to increase under High population/GDP scenarios, with greater increases when mitigation is present. Mitigation leads to more end-use electrification, particularly in the industry and transportation sectors (Fig. S3) because of the aggressive push towards economy-wide decarbonization. In the Low population/GDP scenarios, a slight decrease in the second half of the century is observed, following the trajectories of the population in these scenarios (Fig. S2). This shows that electricity demand is strongly influenced by population trajectory.\n\n<a id='660b57ed-f327-4381-affb-06609284054e'></a>\n\nThe share of renewables in the U.S. electric generation mix has been\nincreasing in recent years, growing from 9.4% to 21.5% between 2000\nand 2022 [38], and this trend is expected to continue due to ongoing\n\n<a id='897b6af5-d781-4376-9286-7aba7e28cca6'></a>\n\nadvancements in renewable energy technologies, decreasing costs of renewables, growing public and political support for clean energy, and the implementation of state and federal policies (i.e., New Source and Performance Standards, the Investment Tax Credit, and the Production Tax credit) in incentivizing renewable energy (including wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and hydro) deployment. Our results (Fig. 1) confirm a general growth in low-carbon energy sources' shares (including renewables and nuclear) with a more pronounced increase under low emission scenarios. In the reference scenarios with low and high population/GDP, we observe a 122 % and 573 % increase from 2020 to 2100, respectively. In the low emission scenarios with low and high population/GDP, the increase is even more substantial, reaching 313 % and an impressive 1120 %, respectively. The share of renewables and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS) also increases substantially in low emission scenarios. This highlights the necessity of CCS for achieving aggressive mitigation targets by 2100. Notably, without mitigation, the share of natural gas increases by 79 % and 330 % from 2020 to 2100 with low and high population/GDP, respectively. This shows that in the absence of mitigation efforts, this cleaner and cheaper source of fuel is expected to meet most of the growing demand for electricity. Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge that such a significant surge in the natural gas share could lead to concerns regarding the sustainability of natural gas resources and the potential for their depletion. This, in turn, could result in higher prices and consequential environmental impacts.\n\n<a id='050f003c-200d-49ce-a794-cd53c822c194'></a>\n\nContrary to the general increasing trend in electricity generation across all scenarios, the implications on water withdrawals and con- sumption for the electricity sector are more complex. Fig. 2a shows that electric sector water withdrawals generally decrease across scenarios, and a drastic decline occurs before 2050 for low emission scenarios: -70 to -67% decrease from 2020 to 2050 for reference scenarios and -93 to -90% for low emission scenarios, respectively. The retirement of coal power plants and more water-efficient generation technologies are the primary contributors to the decline (Fig. S4.a). Other factors, such as increased use of non-water dependent cooling technologies and a shift towards renewable energy sources, also decreased overall water with- drawals [39]. It is worth noting that a slight increase is observed after 2050 for low emission scenarios, mainly attributed to the increasing trend in electricity generation driven by end-use electrification and decarbonization efforts (e.g., CCS). However, the impacts at the state level are diverse and heterogenous (Fig. 2.b). For instance,\n\n<a id='4f557a46-2f98-4d07-a3c7-cef8329aa87f'></a>\n\n<::chart: The image displays a multi-panel stacked bar chart titled \"Fig. 1.

The declining trend of water\nwithdrawal in the electricity sector is also substantiated by historical\ndata from 1990 to 2015 [40]. Several states, including Florida, Illinois,\nMichigan, and New York, experienced a reduction in thermoelectric\npower water withdrawals over this period (Fig. S5). Texas, however,\npresented an exception with a modest increase of 1.14%. On a national\nscale, there was a noteworthy 31.85% decrease in total\nthermoelectric-power water withdrawals within the U.S. during this\ntimeframe. This trend underscores the positive impact of integrating\nlow-carbon technologies and fostering increased use of water-efficient\ntechnologies within the energy sector.\n\n<a id='6cd4f124-8143-4742-a94b-7ea1441c8503'></a>\n\nThe trend of electric sector water consumption varies significantly among the different scenarios (Fig. S6.a). In the reference scenarios, a decline of -35 % is observed in the first half, followed by an increase in the high population/GDP scenario. Gradual decline throughout the century is observed in the low population/GDP scenario. In contrast, under the low emission scenarios, water consumption declines for the\n\n<a id='b0662056-c11d-4de5-a0e6-9965b66bc889'></a>\n\nfirst 30 years, then increases moderately and substantially in the low population/GDP scenario and high population/GDP scenario, respec- tively. The retirement of coal power plants and the uptake of less water- dependent cooling technologies (Fig. S4.b) are the main drivers behind the reduction before the 2030s. The increase in the second half is largely driven by growing electricity generation for end-use electrification. The rate of electricity generation growth to meet the demand outpaces the rate of decline from capital turnover. Notably, among all the scenarios, under the low emission scenario, water consumption reaches its peak across all states, and Texas stands out for having the most substantial water usage (Fig. S6.b). This complex dynamic among water, energy, and mitigation highlights the need for a holistic view that considers the benefits and trade-offs for decarbonizing the energy system at the state level.\n\n<a id='e884b4f4-0bf7-4bb8-aef6-0350bf5acc89'></a>\n\nTo better understand the effect of population growth on electricity\ndemand for each state, an elasticity indicator was developed.

A low value close to zero (whether positive or negative) indicates that population growth is the primary driver behind increases in electricity generation. A larger positive value suggests that factors other than population are influencing the observed growth of electricity generation.\n\n<a id='e7cddb5b-5e3e-4d67-9603-ac57728d6031'></a>\n\nAs can be seen in Fig. 3, the results illustrate heterogeneous responses at the state level. The largest electricity user in most states is the building sector (Fig. S8), whose electricity demand is a direct reflection of population. Therefore, the elasticity indicators for most states are close to 0 and electricity generation grows with population growth. However, in the case of Wyoming, the elasticity indicator is significantly greater than 0.3. This is attributed to Wyoming's relatively small population base [41] and the industry sector being the most significant consumer of electricity within the state (Fig. S8). End-use electrification of the industry sector leads to the increase in electricity generation in Wyoming, a pattern not notably swayed by the state's population dynamics. Similarly, Nebraska's electricity generation is influenced by various factors beyond population growth. Nebraska exhibits high per capita electricity consumption, an energy-intensive industrial sector, and significant energy demands resulting from extreme weather conditions, including hot summers and harsh winters [42]. These combined factors create Nebraska's energy profile, highlighting that population is just one aspect of its multifaceted energy generation equation. For Montana, the surge in electricity generation is influenced by the end-use electrification of the transportation sector. The state has the highest number of vehicles per person [43], and electrification of the transportation sector will lead to greater demand for electricity. Additionally, both West Virginia and Utah are net suppliers of electricity to the regional grid and are among the top states in interstate transfers of electricity [44,45]. Likewise, North Dakota follows a similar pattern, with about two-thirds of its generated power being transmitted to other states and Canada through the regional electric grid [46]. As a result, the increase in electricity generation in West Virginia, Utah, and North Dakota is not solely influenced by their respective populations but is also significantly impacted by electricity transfers to neighboring regions. These observations underscore the notion that while population growth contributes to the escalating electricity demand across the U.S., the pivotal driving factor tends to differ from one state to another.\n\n<a id='713e16e8-7e9a-4f0e-8fa6-90c198f58cae'></a>\n\nWe also examined the environmental consequences of mitigation and socioeconomic development. Fig. 4 illustrates the projected changes in CO2 intensity (million metric tons/EJ) from electricity generation relative to 2015 for each state. CO2 intensity refers to the ratio of CO2 emissions from the electricity sector to the amount of electricity generated. As can be observed, the CO2 intensity of electricity\n\n<a id='cd7a6b9a-9d13-4c5c-86be-31ffae0ee438'></a>\n\ngeneration is expected to decrease over time across all scenarios. However, the rate and pattern of such decrease are heterogeneous across all states. Renewable energies are prioritized in states in the Mountain (i. e., Wyoming), Midwest (i.e., Missouri), and South (i.e., Texas) regions and limited in the Atlantic (i.e., New York) and Pacific regions (i.e., Washington). States characterized by a significant proportion of coal- fired electricity generation, such as Wyoming and West Virginia, are projected to experience significant reductions in the CO2 intensity of their electricity generation. This trend is especially prominent when considering scenarios characterized by low emissions. Anticipated de- clines of approximately -233 and -240 million metric tons/EJ on average by 2080, in comparison to the year 2015, are attributed to the combined impact of retiring coal-fired power generation and the adop- tion of renewable energy sources. Conversely, states like South Dakota, which already embrace a substantial share of renewable energy (with over 80% of its electricity generated from renewables in 2021 [47]), face a more constrained potential for further enhancing their CO2 in- tensity performance. Projections suggest a comparatively narrower scope for improvement, with an average anticipated reduction of approximately -50 million metric tons/EJ by 2080 relative to the reference year of 2015, as outlined in scenarios with low emissions. Texas, on the other hand, exhibits an intriguing dynamic, while it ex- periences a significant reduction in CO2 intensity, with an average reduction of roughly -102 million metric tons/EJ by 2080, it also faces a notable increase in water withdrawal. This dual trend underscores the intricate challenges and trade-offs involved in transitioning to a low-carbon energy framework. It exemplifies how states must carefully balance environmental considerations, such as CO2 emissions, with other critical resources like water. These contrasting outcomes empha- size the distinct capacities of each state to navigate the complex tran- sition toward a low-carbon energy framework.\n\n<a id='ae0b9830-9817-47d1-a816-faef85280a73'></a>\n\nWe also investigated the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) under\nlow emission scenarios in comparison to that of under the \"Stated Pol-\nicies\" and the \"Announced Pledges\" [48] (Fig. 5a). LCOE is a measure of\nthe average net present cost of electricity generation for a generator over\nits lifetime [49]. It includes initial capital investment, operational and\nmaintenance costs, and expected energy output. It has been widely used\nto compare various forms of electricity production for investment de-\ncisions. The \"Stated Policies\" scenario assumes current policies and\nimplementing measures will continue without additional efforts,\nconsidering adopted policies, proposals, and yet-to-be-developed mea-\nsures. In contrast, the \"Announced Pledges\" scenario assumes the suc-\ncessful implementation of government commitments and targets under\nthe Paris Agreement, including Nationally Determined Contributions\n(NDCs) and net zero goals [48]. The LCOE values for reference scenarios\n\n<a id='a586d34f-cdfc-49cb-b68f-98edd3e8ba68'></a>\n\n<::The image displays two choropleth maps of the United States, side-by-side, illustrating an \"Elasticity Indicator\" under \"Low Emission\" and \"Reference\" scenarios, respectively.

Moreover, the LCOEs are also\nhigher for eastern states, with Washington D.C. notably standing out\nwith the highest value (Fig. 5b). This highlights the trade-off associated\nwith mitigation endeavors: while they can effectively curtail CO2\nemissions, they concurrently entail higher lifetime costs for electricity\ngeneration.\n\n<a id='0b7dd175-f6c9-47f1-9f76-a3ab7cd80589'></a>\n\nThrough a comparison of CO2 emissions, our analysis reveals that our\nlow emission scenarios exhibit a more assertive stance than the \"Stated\nPolicies\" scenario yet remain less ambitious than the \"Announced\nPledges\" scenario and lag further behind the U.S. net-zero emissions by\n2050 [50]. This underscores that the trajectory toward emissions in line\nwith RCP2.6 lies beyond the attainable scope of the present \"Stated\nPolicies\" within the United States. Even if we consider a more gradual\n\n<a id='dbdeecae-fc54-4d5e-9287-30723446c788'></a>\n\npopulation growth scenario (Low emission-Low population/GDP), the attainment of net-zero emissions by 2050 remains unfeasible. As such, there's a pressing necessity for more vigorous measures akin to those outlined in the \"Announced Pledges\" to be promptly enacted.\n\n<a id='e5ee6b8d-7e53-46ab-8a87-b0b11e5d091c'></a>\n\nAchieving the net-zero target by 2050 in the U.S. would have profound implications across various sectors, impacting the environment, economy, public health, and international relations. Although our study does not delve into a comprehensive analysis of these implications, we posit that attaining net-zero emissions would demand a significantly higher uptake of renewable energy sources, higher levels of end-use electrification, and a consequent surge in electricity demand [51] compared to our low-emission scenarios. The path taken to achieve net-zero emissions introduces variability in its impact on water usage and mitigation costs [52]. Recognizing this, our study contributes valuable insights to comprehend the broader implications of the U.S. net-zero goal.\n\n<a id='df040c2e-ffac-4ed9-82da-b0f44d3eee99'></a>\n\nConclusion\n\nPrevious research has primarily centered on global and national climate objectives, with less emphasis on how RCP-SSP pathways influence the sub-national electricity sector. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing how climate change mitigation and socioeconomic development interact in the U.S. electric power sector at the state level. The analysis delves into the effects on electricity generation, electricity water withdrawal and consumption, CO2 intensity, and levelized cost of electricity (LOCE) at the state level. The underlying mechanisms that drive the heterogeneous responses at the state level are also examined. Several key conclusions can be drawn from this study.\n\n<a id='ac55eea6-c798-44d6-9d80-6766b1ff8485'></a>\n\nFirst, expanding end-use electrification in the building and industry sectors not only facilitates the attainment of mitigation objectives but also catalyzes a surge in electricity generation. This surge is enabled by a rapid growth of natural gas utilization in conjunction with renewable energy sources. Population growth is the primary catalyst behind the surges in most states. In states where the industry sector is the dominant end-user, the interplay between population and electricity dynamics is comparatively subdued. This underscores the importance of understanding end-use electricity for gauging future electricity demand, considering diverse patterns and electrification potential at the state level.\n\n<a id='f6b08814-2b8e-4400-a7d0-1a959cb6dd69'></a>\n\nSecond, sustainable electricity generation requires balancing multiple considerations, including emissions, environmental conservation, and economic viability [53]. Our low emission scenarios notably reduce water withdrawals, aligning with resource conservation. This shift is propelled by technological advancements, more efficient water cooling, and the embrace of renewable energy sources. Despite the decrease in water withdrawals, water consumption increases. Diverse impacts of mitigation on electricity water use are evident, resulting in increased water withdrawals for certain states (i.e., Texas) while causing reductions for others (i.e., Florida). In our low emission scenarios, renewable energies are prioritized in states in the Mountain (i.e., Wyoming), Midwest (i.e., Missouri), and South (i.e., Texas) regions and limited in the Atlantic (i.e., New York) and Pacific regions (i.e., Washington). Substantial CO2 reduction is achieved, though accompanied by an increased Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), particularly in the eastern states. However, the combined efforts still fall short of achieving the collective commitments under the Paris Agreement. This underscores the importance of managing the balance between water resources, mitigation efforts, and economic feasibility at the state level.\n\n<a id='934aa101-99eb-458e-a95e-8ebda7af99f6'></a>\n\nOverall, this research underscores the complexity of reconciling climate mitigation objectives with local electricity demand and resource constraints. It highlights the need for nuanced, state-specific strategies that balance emissions reduction, electricity demand, and water usage. As we steer through the transition to a more sustainable energy landscape, the collaboration between global targets and regional realities emerges as a compelling necessity, compelling policymakers and\n\n<a id='eecb2470-fca5-4246-bc1f-263c04888e68'></a>\n\n6",
